Method of producing graphene:
In a typical procedure, commercial graphite ﬂakes (2 g) were added to a sealed vial containing Br2 /solvent solution and then left for 2 h for intercalation at room temperature. Similarly, 1-, 3-, and 7-day treatment terms were also used to optimize the pretreatment process. Water, chloroform, and n-decane were selected as solvents. P-graphite ﬂakes were altered through ﬁlter paper and washed with fresh chloroform to remove the remaining Br2 molecules and then was transferred into a clean vial and dried at room temperature in a fume cupboard. Dried samples were labelled as the P-graphite and stored at room temperature in a sealed glass vessel. 20−100 mg of the P-graphite was transferred into a sealed glass tube and irradiated by a microwave irradiation for about 10 s, using a CEM microwave ﬁtted with an Infrared (IR) temperature sensor. The temperature of the solid reaction material was recorded as 360 ± 20°C. The reaction medium was cooled to 50 °C, and the glass tube was opened in a fume cupboard. Highly exfoliated solid graphitic material was obtained and labelled as EG."

Method of producing graphene:
GO suspension (7 mg mL−1) was prepared from natural graphite powder according to a modified Hummers method. The GO sheets have lateral dimensions of 30−50 μm. Seven mL of GO (3 mg mL−1) suspension was deposited onto a cellulose membrane filter to form a GO film through vacuum filtration, annealed at 200 °C for 1 h, and then treated at 1000 °C for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The samples used for solar steam generation in the experiments were treated with O2-plasma."

Method of producing graphene:
We used SiO2/Si as the substrate and ordinary adhesive tape as the transfer medium. Contact with the tape transfers thick graphite flakes from a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystal. Prior to exfoliating thin graphene from these flakes, the SiO2/Si substrate is ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, 2-propanol, and deionized (DI) water, and then subjected to oxygen plasma to remove ambient adsorbates from its surface. Following the plasma cleaning step, the graphite-loaded tape is brought in contact with the substrate. Instead of immediately removing it to complete the exfoliation, the substrate with the attached tape is annealed for 25 min at∼100oC in air on a conventional laboratory hot plate. After the sample is cooled to room temperature, the adhesive tape is removed, which completes the exfoliation."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphite rods are purchased from Alfa Aesar. The graphite rods with a diameter of 3.05 mm and an approximate length of 60 mm are heated in a furnace (at 1050°C for 5 min) in the presence of air. After 5 min, the graphite rods are allowed to cool at room temperature. Thereafter, the graphite rods are washed with Milli-Q water to remove large particles from the surface of the graphite rods. The graphite rods are then used as anode and cathode, i.e., electrodes to be dipped in the electrolyte. Four types of GQDs are prepared i.e., GQD1−GQD4. For GQD1−GQD4, the electrolyte used is a mixture of citric acid monohydrate (0.1 M) and NaOH (0.15− 0.4 M) in Milli-Q water (50 mL). Thereafter, the electrochemical experiments are done with CHI660D Electrochemical Workstation. The separation between the graphite rods is ca. 25 mm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is performed prior to performing chronoamperometry. CV is performed with a voltage range of −1 to +1 V, to wet the graphite electrodes. Thereafter, chronoamperometry is performed with a voltage of  10 V and a sensitivity (I/V) of 0.1 for 30 min. As a result, the color of the electrolyte solution changes from colorless to yellow, which confirms the exfoliation of graphite rod. After completion of this reaction, calcium chloride (0.15 M) is added to the prepared solution. This solution is slightly heated to precipitate calcium citrate. Centrifugation is performed for 15 min at 10 000 rpm twice to separate the calcium citrate precipitate. The supernatant is thereafter filtered through membrane filtration (Himedia, Dialysis Membrane-150, LA401, pore size ca. 2.4nm) for 7 days to remove salt from the solution."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphite exfoliation was conducted in a home-built setup that used rolled graphite foils as working electrodes and platinum foils as counter electrodes. An aqueous solution containing ammonium sulphate with TEMPO was tested as an electrolyte. Before exfoliation, the graphite foil was pretreated by alternately soaking it in liquid nitrogen and absolute ethanol. During this process, violent nitrogen evolution and ethanol solidification promoted the expansion of the graphite foils. The dilation was extremely rapid (within 10 s) and yielded a drastic volume increase at the graphite boundary (∼10 times), which facilitated the expansion of the graphite layers, as did the following anion intercalation steps. When the graphite anodes were immersed in the electrolyte, by applying a static bias of 10 V, they detached into small pieces in less than 10 s, spreading on top of the electrolyte and/or on the bottom of the electrochemical cell. After filtration and copious washing, these exfoliated graphene sheets were collected and then dispersed in DMF via mild sonication. A stable dispersion with a concentration of ∼0.3 mg/mL was obtained that was stable for 2 weeks without apparent aggregation."

Method of producing graphene:
Monolayer graphene was synthesized using thermal CVD. First, a copper (Cu) foil (10 × 10 cm2) was placed in a quartz tube and heated to 1000 °C for 60 min with flowing H2 at 10 sccm. Then, a gas mixture of 45 sccm CH4 and 10 sccm H2 flowed for 30 min under 10 Torr. After 30 min, the heater was turned off and removed from the Cu foil. Next, to handle the monolayer graphene on the front side of the Cu foil, a protective layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated on the graphene on the front side of the Cu foil, and the graphene on the back was removed using oxygen plasma (100 W RF power, 12 s). Then, the PMMA film on the graphene was removed using acetone, and the remaining Cu was etched away using a 0.1 M ammonium persulfate solution. Finally, the monolayer graphene was rinsed in deionized water and transferred onto a p-type silicon substrate without a silicon oxide layer. For the various stacked graphene layers, graphene with PMMA was floated on deionized water and transferred onto another graphene layer on Cu and etched/rinsed again. The transfer and etching/rinsing procedure was repeated for up to 4 layers of graphene. To synthesize graphene with defects, the monolayer graphene on the back side of the copper was removed using oxygen plasma, and the graphene on the front side of the Cu was treated with argon plasma (10 W RF power, 4 s). The PMMA layer was coated onto this graphene, and the Cu foil was removed. Then, the treated graphene was transferred onto silicon or used in the stacking process."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene films were grown on a copper (Cu) substrate by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using a mixture of methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) gasses. A cleaned copper substrate (25 μm thick, 99.999% pure, Alfa Aesar) was heated inside the tube furnace of a mixture of hydrogen and Argon (10% H2, 90% Ar) at 1060 °C for 1 h. This process is important to remove any trace of organic materials and oxide layers from the copper substrate. After heat treatment of copper substrates, the graphene deposition was carried out by passing a mixture of methane and argon (5% CH4, 95% H2) for 10–12 min. The gas composition was changed to hydrogen immediately after the coating process was completed and the system was allowed to return to the room temperature. Graphene deposited on copper was coated with a PMMA layer by spin coating method. The copper substrate was etched with a 1 M aqueous FeCl3 solution. Then the graphene layer was transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate and the PMMA layer was removed by rinsing with acetone"

Method of producing graphene:
Briefly, the procedure is described as follows. Graphene was grown by thermal CVD on a Cu foil, at a temperature of 1000oC and under 1 atm pressure with methane as the precursor gas. A quartz tube with 2 diameter was used as the reaction chamber for our CVD system. Cu foils were rolled up in a roll, but without the rolled-up layers touching to each other. Following the growth, PMMA was spun on graphene/Cu substrate to form PMMA/graphene/Cu sandwich structure. Later, Cu foil was etched away using an iron nitrate aqua solution. After the Cu foil was completely etched away, graphene with PMMA/graphene film was transferred onto a Si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2. The PMMA was then removed by repeatedly rinsing the film in acetone."

Method of producing graphene:
In a typical procedure, 3 g glucose, 3 g FeCl3.6H2O and a certain amount of urea were dissolved in 10 mL water in a crucible. The yellow-coloured solution was vaporized at 80OC in air and further dried in an oven for 24 h, and then a black solid was obtained. The solid was then calcined in a quartz tube furnace at 700 OC for 6 h under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min . After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was placed in a beaker containing 100 mL hydrochloric acid with magnetic stirring for 6 h to remove iron. The solid sample was washed in succession with ultrapure water and acetone for several times. Finally, the sample was dried in an oven at 60 OC overnight to obtain NG-10 (10% mass ratio of urea in the mixture) and NG-20 (20% mass ratio of urea in the mixture), respectively. NG was prepared with the same amount of FeCl3.6H2O and urea without any glucose while CG (C-graphene) was prepared with the same amount of FeCl3.6H2O and glucose but without any urea."

Preparation of EGO
Expandable graphite was treated at 1050 °C in air for 15s. Briefly, heat-treated expandable graphite (1g) was placed in 98% H2SO4 (23mL) in an ice bath. Then, KMnO4 (3g) was slowly added under stirring. The solution was kept at 35°C for 30min, followed by the gradual addition of ultrapure water (46mL) in an ice bath. After 15min, ultrapure water (140mL) and a solution of 30% H2O2 (12.5mL) were added to generate Expandable graphene oxide (EGO). The resultant EGO was washed with a solution of 5% HCl to a pH value of 7, followed by ultrasonication forming a homogeneous yellow solution. The obtained EGO solution was dialyzed at 60°C until SO42− anion was undetectable by Ba2+ cation. The as-prepared EGO colloid solution was diluted to a concentration of 0.6mg/mL and then used for the following electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process.

EPD of EGO 
EGO film was deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode. A cleaned ITO slide (20mm × 20mm) with a sheet resistance of about 10Ω/sq and a stainless-steel plate with an in-between distance of 15mm were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. EPD was carried out at 150V in constant potential mode. After EPD for 45s, the resultant EGO film was slowly withdrawn from the solution.

Synthesizing nanocomposite film
The EGO film was electrochemically reduced in situ in 0.1M KCl and scanned within a potential range of 0 to −1.0 V at a scan rate of 10mV/s. This was conducted on a CHI660C Electrochemical Workstation using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical system which consists of an EGS film-coated ITO slide as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl solution) electrode as the reference electrode. To obtain the desired composite film electrode, Pt nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the EGS film at a constant potential of −0.25 V for 1800 s in a mixed solution of 3 mM H2PtCl6 and 0.5 M H2SO4.

Method of producing graphene:
A horizontal AP-CVD system with a quartz tube of length 90 cm and diameter of 50 mm was taken as the reactor placed in two split furnaces. Cu foil (Nilaco Corp.) of thickness 20 μm and purity 99.99% was used as substrate for graphene synthesis. Solid waste plastic used for material packaging is used as carbon source in these studies. Cu foil was cleaned by sonicating in acetone for 30 min and placed in the growth furnace without further treatment. Cu substrate was annealed for 30 min in 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of H2 at 1020 °C before the feedstock was introduced. Annealing is an important step to enlarge Cu grain size, reduce lattice mismatch and dislocations, which help to limit number of nucleation sites. 3 mg of waste plastic as carbon source was placed in a ceramic boat inside the lower temperature furnace. Graphene growth was carried out for 90 minutes using a gas mixture of Ar and H2 with the flow rate 98 and 2.5 sccm, respectively. Supply of precursor was continuously increased during the growth process to provide sufficient carbon atoms for uninterrupted growth of graphene crystal. The injection rate of polymeric components contained in the waste plastic was changed by the rate of evaporation. Thereafter, it was allowed to cool at a cooling rate of (~16OC/min). Individual graphene crystal was transferred to SiO2/Si substrate by coating a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) supporting layer. Etching of underneath Cu foil was achieved by using a 50 mg/ml concentrated Fe(NO3)3 solution. Subsequently, PMMA/graphene stack layer was transferred to SiO2/Si substrate and PMMA coating was dissolved in acetone. Finally, transferred graphene was treated with a diluted nitric acid solution to remove the residual Fe(NO3)3 and dried in air."

Method of producing graphene:
Cu foils of 2 × 2 cm2 were implanted with 70 keV C− ions to nominal fluences (ϕC) of (2, 4, 5, 8, and 10) × 1015 C cm−2 at room temperature (RT). The peak excess-C concentration for these implants was calculated from TRIM simulation to be in the range of 1.6 × 1020–8 × 1020 C cm−3 (0.19–0.95 at.%). The C-implanted Cu foils were heated to the annealing temperature (TA) under vacuum. After dwelling at TA for 15 min, the samples were slowly cooled to RT at a rate of ∼10 °C/min to form a graphene layer on the Cu foils. TA was varied from 900 to 1100 °C. The graphene layer was easily transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate by using a sacrificial PMMA layer as previously reported in the literature. Briefly, after a PMMA layer had been spincoated onto the graphene layer/Cu foil, the Cu foil was etched away in an ammonium persulfate solution (1 M), thereby leaving the detached PMMA/graphene layer in a water bath. Then, the PMMA/graphene layer was transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate, allowed to dry, and placed in an acetone bath to dissolve the PMMA support layer. After a rinse with water, the graphene layer was finally obtained on a SiO2/Si substrate. In this work, two kinds of high-purity Cu foils (Alfa Aesar) were used: one of 0.515 ppm carbon content and the other free of carbon. No graphene was formed on Cu foils free of carbon by the same C-implantation and successive thermal treatment."

Method of producing graphene:
Hummer method was used to oxidize the graphite for the synthesis of GO. The as-prepared GO was thermally expanded to synthesize TEGO by rapidly heating it in a Lindberg tube furnace. Generally, the as-prepared GO was first loaded in a quartz boat of length 100 mm and diameter 20 mm, which was then inserted into a 1.5 m-long quartz tube with inner diameter of 22 mm and outer diameter of 25 mm. After the tube furnace was heated to 1050 °C and argon was flowed though the tube for 10 min, with a flow rate of 200 mL/min, the sample boat of GO placed in the quartz tube was rapidly moved into the middle heating zone of the furnace and kept there for 30 s, before being quickly removed from the heating zone. The resulting TEGO was first reduced by H2 for 2 h at 450 °C in a gas flow of H2 (100 mL/min) and argon (100 mL/min). Then, the reduced TEGO platelets were stirred for 1 h in a solution of N-methylpyrolidone (NMP) before being dispersed for 2 h at 40 °C by sonication to form a homogenous suspension. Finally, centrifugation was used to remove thick multilayer pieces and not fully exfoliated graphite flakes from the TEGO-generation process, and to retain the thin graphene sheets in the supernatant."

Wheat straw was used as the starting material to obtain few-layer graphene by carbonization and graphitization of its hydrothermal product. Detailed steps are as follows: the raw material was first cut into small pieces (approximately 3 cm in length) and washed with distilled water, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h before use. Within the subsequent hydrothermal treatment, 4 g of the washed wheat straw was immersed in a 400 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave wherein 280 mL of homogeneous 3 M KOH solution was contained, and then the autoclave was heated at a temperature of 150 °C for 6 h. When cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resulting samples were fetched out, collected by vacuum filtration with quantitative filter paper, washed by ultrasonication in 120 mL deionized water for 30 min and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The following high temperature pyrolysis and chemically activation was carried out at 800 °C for 3 h under the protection of N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a N2 flow rate of 150 cm3 min−1 . After that, the carbonaceous product was thoroughly washed with 0.5 M HCl solution to remove the residual KOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h.

Method of producing graphene:
Two 1 x 2 cm quartz wafers were used as substrate to grow graphene. The quartz wafers were first cleaned by ultrasonication in methanol, acetone, and DI water, and were dried by high purity N2 gas. Photoresist S-1805 (from Shipley Comp.) was diluted with a volume ratio of 1:6 in Thinner-P (from MicroChem Corp.), and was then spin-coated on the quartz wafer at 10,000 rpm. The thickness of the coated film is about 30 nm. The photoresist-coated quartz wafers were then baked for 5 min at 120oC. One coated quartz wafer was covered by another piece of quartz wafer, and then mounted on a sample stage in a vacuum chamber. Before growing graphene, the chamber was pumped and purged by high-purity N2 gas, and maintained at a pressure below 0.1 Torr. A continuous wave (CW) Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was focused on the S-1805 film through the transparent quartz substrate using a lens of 150 mm focal length. The carbon atoms were decomposed from the laser heated photoresist, then dissolved in the molten quartz, and extracted to form graphene when the temperature of quartz was decreased.

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene was synthesized on polycrystalline Cu foils (50 um thick Alfa-Aesar, purity 99.9999%) in a rapid thermal processing CVD chamber, fitted with a pressure regulation device and temperature control by an optical pyrometer. The typical sample size was a few cm2 . Cu foils were pre-cleaned in acetic acid at 35 degree Celsius for 10 min in order to remove the surface oxide. The samples were immediately loaded in the CVD growth reactor and pumped to the base vacuum pressure (105 mbar). Then, the Cu foil was heated to 1060oC and held for 5 min under Ar/H2:100/5 sccm (standard cubic centimetre per minute at standard temperature and pressure) with 10 Torr chamber pressure. Afterwards, the gaseous carbon source, CH4 (20 sccm), was introduced for 5 min to carry out the graphene growth. Finally, the sample was fast cooled (30oC/s) below 700oC and further slowly to room temperature under H2 and Ar ambient. It should be noted that its total duration is only 30 min, which is much less than the process time in standard hot-wall furnaces"

Method of producing graphene:
Synthesis of GO and rGO from graphite powder was achieved using H2SO4/KMnO4 as oxidant upon heating on a hot plate with continuous stirring (900 rpm) for 24 h. Specifically, the 4 g of graphite and 400 mL of 98% H2SO4 were placed in separate 1000 mL elementary flasks. The mixtures were then heated for 2 h at temperatures of 60oC for one mixture and 120 oC for the other, under constant stirring using magnetic stirrer followed by the gradual addition of 10 g of KMnO4 to each reaction mixture and heating these mixtures for the next 22 h under similar conditions. After the reaction mixture was cooled, 13 mL of 30% H2O2 was added to complete the oxidation process followed by the addition of cold deionized water. Upon leaving the mixtures overnight, a yellow solution supernatant with brown precipitate was obtained from the sample prepared at 60 oC, while a clear supernatant solution with black precipitate was obtained from the sample heated at 120 oC. The obtained samples were purified by washing with deionized water in repeated ultracentrifugation (10,000 rpm) and vacuum filtration until the solutions become neutral and free of impurity. Acetone was added to remove water residual from the samples and ensure easy drying at room temperature. Finally, the solid samples were ultrasonicated for 40 min and made ready for characterization."

Method of producing graphene:
In this paper, we report CVD growth of large-area, high quality graphene on Cu foils using aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol) as carbon sources. The experimental procedure for graphene growth begins with cleaning the Cu catalysts. Twenty-five micrometer thick, Cu foils (Alfa Aesar, N# 13382) were immersed in 1 M acetic acid at 60oC for 10 min followed by immersion in acetone and 2-propanol for 10 min in each solvent. The Cu foils were then loaded into a quartz tube and exposed to a 10 sccm H2, 10 mTorr environment while the temperature was raised to the growth temperature, optimally 850 oC. The quartz tube was held at this temperature for 20 min to remove any generated oxide or oxide layer on the Cu. Alcohols were outgassed to 10-6 Torr using 3–5 freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Upon introduction of the alcohol vapor to the system, the tube pressure increases to 1 Torr, a pressure below the vapor pressure of all three alcohols at room temperature, thus allowing alcohol vapors to be drawn into the chamber. The Cu films were exposed to the alcohol vapor for approximately 5 min at 1 Torr. Next, the alcohol vapor was cut off and the system was rapidly cooled to room temperature with rates varying from 300 oC /min to 30 oC /min while maintaining H2 pressure at 10 mTorr. After growth, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, 950 kDa, 4% solution in anisole) was spin coated onto the surface of the graphene coated Cu. A hard bake at 120 oC  for 1 min was used to stiffen the PMMA handle. The sample was then immersed in a room temperature ammonium persulfate (0.1 M) bath to etch the Cu foil. The remaining PMMA-supported graphene was then carefully transferred to a de-ionized water bath to remove residual etchant. The target substrate was used to lift the PMMA-supported graphene from the water bath. Heavily doped Si (ndoped, 8–20 mX-cm) with 300 nm of dry, chlorinated thermal oxide, was chosen as the substrate for back-gated electrical transport measurements. The sample was then dried at ambient temperature for 48 h in a clean environment. Liquid PMMA is drop cast on the stiffened PMMA handle to release tension and promote conformal adhesion to the substrate. The PMMA was then dissolved in a warm acetone bath to produce a pristine graphene layer on the target substrate"

Method of producing graphene:
High purity graphite rods (6 mm, 99.999%, Aldrich) were used as electrodes. Poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, Mw = 70,000, Aldrich) was dissolved in de-ionized (DI) water to form the electrolyte (0.001 M). In a typical synthesis, two graphite rods were placed in an electrolysis cell filled with the electrolyte. A constant potential of 5 V (DC voltage) was applied to the two electrodes (CHI 660 C Electrochemical Workstation). After 20 min electrolysis, black product gradually appeared at the positive electrode (anode). The exfoliation continued for 4 h. Then the product (a dispersion) was taken from the electrolysis cell. The dispersion was centrifuged at low speed (1000 rpm) to remove large agglomerates. The top of the dispersion was then decanted. This graphene–PSS suspension is very stable in nature. After 6 months storage, there is no any precipitation. To obtain dry graphene powders, the dispersion was washed with DI water and ethanol, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80oC. The yield of graphene was estimated by weighting the dried graphene powders and the dried sediment. Our electrolytic exfoliation method results in producing graphene at a yield at about 15 wt.%. "

The Ar plasma treated Ni foils was immediately loaded onto the PG (Pyrolytic Graphite)/PBN (Pyrolytic Boron Nitride) heater stage. The reaction chamber was pumped down to 3 mTorr using a rotary vacuum pump. The Ni foil was heated up to 1000 degree Celsius at a 100 degree Celsius /min heating rate, and maintained for 30 min in the N2/H2 atmosphere (N2:H2 = 700:100 sccm, total pressure 4.5 Torr). Subsequently, the CVD growth of graphene was triggered by the addition of CH4 (8 sccm) along with N2 (700 sccm) and H2 (100 sccm) to maintain 20 Torr of the chamber pressure. After CVD growth, the samples were cooled down from 1000 to 500oC with a consistent cooling rate of 200oC /min, under a flow of N2 (700 sccm). After CVD growth, the as-grown graphene films were transferred to different target substrates using the following method. First, a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated onto the as-grown graphene at 500 rpm for 5 s first, then 2500 rpm for 20 s. The PMMA/graphene/Ni foil was cured at 180 oC for 1 min, and subsequently, the rear side of the Ni foil was polished to remove the coatings. The graphene/PMMA film was released from the Ni foil by chemical etching of Ni with a FeCl3 (1 M) solution over a period of 24 h, followed by rinsing with de-ionized water. The floating PMMA supported-graphene was transferred onto arbitrary substrates such as a SiO2/Si substrate and a flexible transparent PET substrate (0.125 mm thick film).

The graphene oxide was synthesized according to the modified Hummer’s method using graphite powder as the starting material. Briefly, graphite powder (2 g) was stirred in 98% H2SO4 (35 mL) for 2 h. KMnO4 (6 g) was gradually added to the above solution while keeping the temperature less than 20oC. The mixture was then stirred at 35–40 oC for 30 min. The resulting solution was diluted by adding 90 mL of water under vigorous stirring and a dark brown color suspension was obtained. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 mL of distilled water and 30% H2O2 solution (10 mL). After continuously stirred for 2 h, the mixture was washed by repeated centrifugation and filtration using 5% HCl aqueous solution in order to remove the residual metal ions. Further, the centrifugation process was repeated with distilled water until the pH of the solution becomes neutral. Finally, a brown colored precipitate of graphitic oxide was obtained by filtration and was allowed to dry under vacuum. The exfoliation of graphitic oxide into graphene oxide was achieved by ultrasound irradiation. Briefly, 0.2 g of as-synthesized graphitic oxide was redispersed in 200 mL of distilled water and allowed to sonication for 30 min which results in exfoliation of graphitic oxide into monolayers of graphene oxide (GO) and is further used for the synthesis of graphene."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene film synthesis was performed in a SEKI AX5200S MPCVD system with H2 (50 sccm) and CH4 (5 sccm) as the feed gases. A 25 um thick copper foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.8% purity) was used as the substrate. The foil was cut in 2 · 2 cm2 pieces and placed into the MPCVD chamber, which was evacuated to a base pressure of 2 Torr and then filled with high-purity hydrogen at a pressure of 10 Torr. The Cu foil was supported by a ceramic stand that elevated it from the Mo puck by about 15 mm. The elevation of the Cu foil above Mo puck was found to be critical for the growth of the films because it ensures a strong coupling between the plasma and the Cu foil, thus enabling rapid self-heating of the foil by the microwave plasma. No additional heater was used. The thermocouple attached to the substrate table indicated a maximum reading of approximately 65oC during the process. A dual-wavelength infrared pyrometer indicated a maximum temperature of 700 ± 25 oC. However, as the copper foil is coated with graphene, the surface emissivity changes, making reliable IR measurements difficult. The entire growth is accomplished in less than 5 min and generally involves two stages. First, in a plasma cleaning and annealing step, the foil is kept in 400 W hydrogen plasma for 3 min. A H2 flow rate of 50 sccm was used with downstream pressure control to maintain 10 Torr chamber pressure throughout the process. This process leads to rapid self-heating and removal of copper oxide from the foil surface. The second stage involves introduction of CH4 (while maintaining the hydrogen plasma) at a flow of 5 sccm for a short duration (between 30 s and 2 min), providing approximately 10% CH4 concentration in hydrogen. Depending on the growth duration and whether or not annealing is used, different forms of carbon can be deposited"

KMnO4 (8.0 g) was slowly added to the mixture at 25oC for 2 h without stirring. Milli-Q water (90 ml) was added to the suspension and kept stirring (100 rpm) at 95 oC  for 12 h. Then, 30% H2O2 (30 ml) was slowly added to the diluted suspension. For the purification, the mixture was filtered through polyester fiber (Carpenter Co.). The filtrate was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min and the remaining solid material (GO) was then washed in succession with 200 ml of water, 100 ml of 30% HCl, and 100 ml of ethanol. This process was repeated for 3 times. The final product GO was collected by filtration and vacuum dried. 

Reduction of GO powder (100 mg) was sonicated in Milli-Q water (30 ml) for 30 min. Hydrazine hydrate (3 ml) was added to the as-dispersed suspension. After that, the mixture was refluxed at 98oC for 24 h. For workup, the product (rGO) was harvested using the same purification method mentioned above. The final product rGO was collected by filtration and vacuum dried."

Method of producing graphene:
GO was prepared from purified natural graphite (SP-1, 30-lm nominal particle size, Bay Carbon, Bay City, MI) by the Hummers method. Reduction of exfoliated GO with hydrazine hydrate. In a typical procedure, GO (100 mg) was loaded in a 250-mL roundbottom flask and water (100 mL) was then added, yielding an inhomogeneous yellow-brown dispersion. This dispersion was sonicated using a Fisher Scientific FS60 ultrasonic bath cleaner (150 W) until it became clear with no visible particulate matter. Hydrazine hydrate (1.00 mL, 32.1 mmol) was then added and the solution heated in an oil bath at 100oC under a water-cooled condenser for 24 h over which the reduced GO gradually precipitated out as a black solid. This product was isolated by filtration over a medium fritted glass funnel, washed copiously with water (5 · 100 mL) and methanol (5 · 100 mL), and dried on the funnel under a continuous air flow through the solid product cake."

Method of producing graphene:
Synthesis of porous graphene. Exfoliated graphite oxide fakes, with ~0.5–20 μm lateral size and ~1.5nm thickness, were prepared following the modifed Hummers method. Graphite was initially oxidized to form graphite oxide, which was further exfoliated and chemically reduced to graphene sheets. The thickness of GO sheets varied between 0.8–1 nm. Before the reduction, 500 ml aqueous solution of graphite oxide with concentration of 1 mg/ml was synthesized, and further exfoliated for 2 h in an ultrasonic bath (Bandelin Sonorex RK-100H). The pH values were found to be in the range 9–11. 150ml GO (1mg/ml) was combined with 1.5ml of hydrazine (35wt%) under magnetic stirring in a fask which was heated to 100 °C. Afer 12h reaction, hydrazine (1.5ml) was again added to perform the reaction for additional 2h to ensure full reduction of the GO. The rGO was allowed to settle, washed with distilled water and fltered until the supernatant became clear. To obtain porous nanosheets, the fltered product was oven-dried in vacuum overnight and then thermally treated at 200 °C in Ar for 12 h under a slow ramp rate of 3 °C min-1 ."

Method of producing graphene:
Oxidation of graphite: firstly, 1 g graphite powders (the mean diameter of 18 mm provided by Mei Ge Electrical Carbon Co., Ltd. China) were poured into the mixture of 92 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (95–98%) and 24 mL nitric acid (65%) in a 500 mL flask(under ice bath). After the suspended solution was strongly stirred at 0oC for 15 min. Then 6 g KMnO4 (AR) was gradually added in the above mixture solution. The suspended solution was stirred continuously for 1 h. We called this process low temperature oxidation. Subsequently, in order to increase the oxidation degree of the graphite, the mixture was heated to 80 oC for 30 min, and then 92 mL of deionized water was slowly added in. The suspension was stirred at 80 oC for 30 min again. After that, 5 mL H2O2 (30%) was added into the solution to reduce the residual permanganate. On completion of the reaction, the mixture was washed with 5% solution of HCl and water until sulfate could not be detected with BaCl2. Finally, the GO powders were dried at 80 oC for 24 h. The dosage of oxidizer was controlled to produce oxidized graphite of different degrees. 2.1.2. Expansion of GO In this step, the obtained GO powders (400 mg) were loaded in a quartz boat. The quartz boat was placed into a 25-mm internal diameter; 1-m long quartz tube. After the sample was flushed with argon for 30 min (the velocity of argon is 100 mL/min ), the quartz tube was heated to 300 oC for 1 h (at heating rates of 15 oC/min) in tube furnace under argon flow. 2.1.3. Reduction of EG Graphene sheets obtained from thermal expansion contain residual H and OH groups. Therefore, to remove H and OH groups, the as-prepared EG were reduced in a tube furnace by H2 (the gas flow is consisted of H2 (40 mL/min) and argon (60 mL/min)) for 2 h at 500 oC. After the GS was dispersed into ethanol, to remove a small amount of precipitate, post-treatment of sonication and centrifugation is used and then the desired graphene sheets are collected for further characterizations."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene was prepared by reduction of graphene oxide by hydrazine. Graphene oxide was synthesized from graphite powder by a modified Hummers method. A 2.5 g of KMnO4 was slowly added into a mixture of 5 g of graphite, 3.75 g of NaNO3, and 375 mL of concentrated H2SO4 with stirring for 2 h at 0oC. After 5 days of vigorous stirring at room temperature, a 700 mL of 5 wt.% H2SO4 solution was slowly added and stirred for 2 h at 98 oC. Then, a 15 mL of 30 wt.% hydrogen peroxide solution was added in the cooled mixture and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Repeating cycles of centrifugation and redispersing in a mixed solution of 3 wt.% of H2SO4 and 0.5 wt.% of hydrogen peroxide were employed to purify the precipitate. Further washing used 3 wt.% HCl and water and passed through a weak basic ion-exchange resin to remove the remaining acid. The resultant solution was filtrated and dried to obtain the graphene oxide. The stable suspension of chemically reduced graphene oxide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was prepared according to the Ruoff procedure. First, 30 mg of graphene oxide was dispersed in 1 mL of water by sonication for 1 h. Then, 9 mL of DMF was added in 1 mL of water containing 30 mg of graphene. Finally, 10 uL of hydrazine was added in the prepared 10 mL mixed solution with vigorous stirring for 12 h at 80 oC and a black suspension of graphene was obtained. "

Briefly, 5 g carbonized powder, 30 g KMnO4 and 5 g NaNO3 were slowly added into 220 ml concentrated H2SO4 in sequence and vigorously stirred in an ice bath for 10 h. The mixture was then heated to 35 °C and maintained for 3 h with continuous stirring. The mixture was then diluted by 440 ml distilled water, and the temperature of mixture was controlled to be under 85 °C during the dilution process. After that, H2O2 (30 wt%) was added into the mixture drop by drop until the color of solution became bright yellow. The mixture was finally centrifuged (8000 rpm, 6 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining solid was then successively washed with 1 M HCl solution and deionized water several times by centrifugation until the pH of the solution was neutral. The obtained solid was ultrasonicated in deionized water for 8 h, and the resultant suspension was then dried by freeze drying to obtain graphene oxide. For the thermal exfoliation-reduction of graphene oxide process, 1 g of obtained graphene oxide was placed in a quartz crucible (with a lid) and heated at 900 °C for 5 min in a muffle furnace under nitrogen atmosphere.

2.2. Preparation of GO GO was prepared from graphite powder through a modified Hummers method. In brief, graphite powder (0.5 g) was dispersed in 23 ml of concentrated H2SO4. After magnetic stirring for 0.5 h, KMnO4 (3 g) and NaNO3 (0.5 g) were slowly added into the above solution with stirring and the temperature of the mixture was kept below 20oC by cooling. After oxidizing for 2 h, the reaction mixture was transferred to 35 oC water bath and stirred for 32 h. Then, the temperature of mixture was raised to 95 oC after adding 140 ml of DI water. The mixture was maintained at as mentioned temperature and continued stirring for another 2 h. The color of solution changed from dark brown to bright yellow during the drop-wise addition of 3 ml of 30% H2O2. The synthetic mixture was repeatedly washed and settled with DI water until the PH of solution was 7. After drying at 60 oC under vacuum, graphite oxide sample was obtained as grey powder. Graphite oxide powder was dispersed in DI water to create 1 mg/ml of dispersion. Exfoliated graphite oxide to form GO was achieved through ultrasonication (100W, 40 kHz) for 3 h, in which the bulk graphite oxide powder was transformed into GO. 2.3. Reduction of GO using sodium acetate trihydrate solution Graphene was synthesized via the chemical reduction of GO by sodium acetate trihydrate. A typical procedure was as follows, 1.10 g CH3COONa·3H2O was dispersed into 55 ml of GO dispersion (1 mg/ml). After being stirred for 0.5 h, the solution was stirred for 24 h at 95 oC. During reduction, the yellow-brown solution gradually changed into a black “fluffy” precipitate.

Method of producing graphene:
We exploited liquid phase exfoliation of graphite to produce the graphene inks in NMP and in the mixture EtOH/H2O. For the NMP-based ink, 1 g of graphite flakes (Sigma Aldrich) was dispersed in 100 mL of NMP and ultrasonicated (Branson ® 5800) for 6 hours. The obtained dispersion was then ultracentrifuged at ~16000 g (in a Beckman Coulter Optima™ XE-90 with a SW41Ti rotor) for 30 mins at 15 °C, exploiting sedimentation-based separation (SBS) to remove thick flakes and un-exfoliated graphite. After the ultracentrifugation process, we collected the supernatant by pipetting. The optimization of ink-jet printing ideally requires highly concentrated inks. To achieve such a target, the supernatant extracted after the first ultracentrifugation process was further ultracentrifuged at ~200,000g for 60 mins at 15 °C. The high g force value promotes the sedimentation of the graphene flakes at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tubes taking advantage of the higher density of the graphene flakes (~2.1g/cm3) in comparison with the solvent (ρNMP = 1.03 g/cm3). The pellet (sedimented graphene flakes) is collected and the supernatant is discarded. The pellet was re-suspended in 3 mL of pure NMP using an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. This time was sufficient to re-disperse the graphene flakes, thus obtaining a stable (for more than 2 months) ink."

Graphene oxide was prepared from graphite flakes(40mm) via an improved Hummers’ method. A mixture of H2SO4(95%) and H3PO4(85%) in a 9:1 vol. equiv.ratio. was added to a mixture of KMnO4 and graphite flakes (3:1 wt. equiv.). Because of heat evolution from the exothermic process, a delay (15–20 min) was introduced to bring the temperature down to room temperature. The mixture was then placed on a heating mantle at 50oC, with constant stirring for 12 h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured onto ice [400 mL of deionized (DI) water were used to make the ice] with 30% H2O2 (3 mL). The solution was then sieved using a testing sieve and the filtrate was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4h). The supernatant was then discarded, and the remaining solid was sequentially washed with water, 30% HCl, and ethanol (twice in each case); for each wash, the mixture was sifted through the sieve and the filtrate was then centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4h) using a Mega 17R small, high-speed, refrigerated centrifuge machine, and the supernatant was decanted. After the multiple washing treatments, the remaining materials were coagulated using ethyl ether and then filtered through a PTFE membrane with a micropore size of 0.2 mm, followed by drying in vacuum. Graphene oxide was placed in a beaker and sonicated with DI water (0.1 mg mL1) for 5 min, using an ultrasonicator. 2-4ml of NH4OH (25–30%) were added to adjust the pH to 11.

Method of producing graphene:
A carbon-containing film (SiC or amorphous carbon) and a metal film (Ni) were deposited by sputtering onto a Si substrate in the order of either substrate/SiC/Ni, or substrate/Ni/SiC. After deposition, the stacks were subjected to a rapid-thermal-process at temperatures ranging from 650 to 1000oC. We find that graphene always grows atop the stack, irrespective of the deposition sequence of the two layers. After RTP, the Ni or Ni-silicide layer is etched away in HCl solution. This resulted in two possibilities: For thick Ni layers (>100 nm), after the Ni-silicide is dissolved in HCl, the graphene floats off the Si substrate and can be collected and transferred to a new substrate, which is an approach already employed by others. However, if the Ni layer is sufficiently thin (<100 nm), graphene is retained on the original substrate."

Nickel powder (Alfa Aesar) of 2–3 um average particle size and 0.68m2/g in specific surface area was pelletized into 6.4 cm diameter pellets using a compression machine (Carver, 973214A). The applied force was 10 MPa and varied for different pellet thicknesses. The nickel pellet was placed on a quartz platform inside a quartz tube for growing of graphene by CVD. The nickel pellet was heated up to 1000oC in a tube furnace (FirstNano, ET1000) under Ar (1000 sccm). Hydrogen (325 sccm) was then introduced for 15 min, to reduce any metal catalyst oxide. Then, CH4 was introduced for 5 min. Various hydrocarbon flow rates were tested (25sccm corresponding to concentration of 1.9 vol%). The pellet was then cooled to room temperature with a rate of 100 oC /min under Ar (1,000 sccm) and H2 (325 sccm). The nickel pellet shrank ~30% in all dimensions after CVD. The final 3D graphene structure in the form of pellet was produced by etching out nickel from the graphene/nickel pellet with HCl (3 M) at 80 oC for 10 h. The obtained graphene pellet was washed with water to remove residual acid and dried at room temperature. Graphene paper was obtained by compressing the graphene pellet with a press between 2 flat steel plates. Different thicknesses of graphene paper can be fabricated by changing the compression load."

FLG was synthesized in a MW PECVD set-up composed of an Iplas Cyrannus MW plasma source mounted on top of a stainless-steel vessel. The plasma source consists of a 6 kW, 2.45 GHz cylindrical MW resonator, which couples the MW power through five annular slots in a quartz tube and enables operation either in the TM012 or in the surface wave plasma mode. For all the experiments, the plasma was operated in the TM012 mode. A flexible substrate holder allows free positioning of substrates along the axis of the quartz tube. A broad range of materials was used as substrates, including quartz, silicon, nickel, platinum, germanium, titanium, tungsten, stainless steel, tantalum and molybdenum. Prior to growth, the substrates are heated for 20 min in a 2 kW MW plasma at 40 Torr, using a H2 flow of 200 sccm. This plasma is sufficiently powerful to heat the samples from room temperature up to 700oC, as measured by a thermocouple embedded in the substrate holder. Immediately after the heating step, CH4 mixed with H2 is introduced into the growth chamber with a CH4/H2 ratio of 1/8 at a total flow rate of 200 sccm. Keeping the plasma power and pressure at 2 kW and 40 Torr, respectively, FLG was grown with this gas mixture for various growth times ranging from 1 to 3000 s."

In this work, the process of preparing FGSs consists of two steps: (i) room-temperature oxidation to generate GO and (ii) low-temperature exfoliation to obtain FGSs. The GO was produced by a modified Brodie method using precursor graphite as a starting material. One gram of precursor graphite (99.999%, 200 mesh, Alfar Aesar, USA) was mixed with 8.5 g sodium chlorate and 20 ml fuming nitric acid at room temperature and stirred for 24 h. The mixed solution was then neutralized with deionized water and dried at 80oC for 12 h. The completely dried GO was transferred to a chamber with a temperature-programmed furnace. Ar gas was pumped into the chamber at a flow rate of 3000 ml/min and the temperature was increased at a ramping rate of 9.0 oC/min from room temperature to 300 oC. Exfoliation took place in a temperature range 270–295 oC. Various structural properties of the obtained FGS were compared with those of commercially available GSs prepared by the conventional high-temperature exfoliation with sulfuric acid (N-BARO TECH, Korea)."

The 25um thick Cu foil used in this work, was supplied by Alfa Aesar (purity 99.8%, lot no. 13382). The foil was electropolished in an electrochemical cell made using a commercially available Coplin staining jar as the vessel and an electrolyte solution. The grooves of the staining jar ensured that the foil was kept flat and parallel to the counter electrode (a thicker Cu plate), which helped achieve homogeneous polishing of the surface. Graphene films were synthesized at a pressure of 25 mbar inside a 4 inch cold-wall CVD system (Aixtron BM). To achieve more reproducible atmospheric and thermal conditions and to reduce the effective gas flow, the sample was contained in a custom-made enclosure, comprising a quartz disk suspended 6 mm above the sample using graphite spacers. A typical CVD growth process contains four distinct parts: temperature ramp-up (I), annealing (II), growth (III) and cool-down (IV). The annealing as well as the growth was performed at approximately 1060 °C, which was calibrated according to the melting point of Cu. The annealing time was kept at 10 min in all cases. The gas flow during the temperature rampup and the annealing stages was 1000 sccm. The samples which had the largest grains were annealed in argon atmosphere; other samples were annealed in hydrogen. The gas flow rates during growth were typically set to 1 sccm of methane, 20 sccm of hydrogen and 900 sccm of argon. The growth time was one hour. After the growth, the chamber was cooled in argon/hydrogen atmosphere to a temperature of 120 °C before introducing the samples to air."

The CH4 gas of 1 SCCM (denoting cubic centimeter per minute at STP) and the mixed gases of 10% H2 and 90% Ar (forming gas) of 100 SCCM were introduced in a hot-wall tubular reaction chamber. The Cu foil (Alfa Aesar) was pre-treated with an acetic acid solution at 60oC for 10 min, followed by washing with de-ionized water. The foil was heated to a graphene synthesis temperature (950 oC) and annealed for 10 min with forming gas flow (100 SCCM) to remove native oxides from the Cu foil and to enlarge its grains.

Method of producing graphene:
Pre-cleaning step: To remove impurities, the foil was briefly dipped in Ni etchant solution for 30–90 s depending on the number of impurities observed (Note: we have observed that Cu foil having more impurities requires a longer surface cleaning time. However, if the cleaning time is more than 2 min, the copper foil becomes severely damaged and is not useful for growth of graphene.) The main component of the Ni etchant is nitric acid, which reacts with Cu according to Cu(s) + 4HNO3 (aq) -> Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2NO2(g) + 2H2O. (1) During this reaction, the Cu on the surface is being oxidized and dissolved in the solution; at the same time NO2 gas is violently generated, helping to push the impurity particles away. In this way, the original surface of the Cu foil, together with the impurities, is scraped off and a new, clean but very rough surface is obtained. After cleaning, the copper foil is dipped in DI water for further washing. This washing process is carried out three times, each time with fresh DI water. It should be noted that this step is very important. To remove the DI water from the copper completely, the copper foil is briefly washed with acetone and isopropanol and dried by blowing with N2. 

2.1. Graphene growth procedure Graphene was synthesized by low pressure chemical vapor deposition using a copper foil (25 µm, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar) as a catalytic metal substrate. After the pre-cleaning process, the copper foil was annealed at 1000oC for 30 min under a 10 sccm hydrogen atmosphere (330 mTorr) to increase the grain size and to obtain a smooth surface, followed by graphene synthesis under 5 and 10 sccm of methane and hydrogen atmospheres for 40 min (450 mTorr) while maintaining the same temperature. During the cooling of the chamber, 10 sccm of hydrogen was flowed until the furnace was cooled to room temperature."

While maintaining vigorous agitation, natural graphite powder (carbon content >98 wt%, 1.5 g) and sodium nitrate (1.5 g) were mixed with sulfuric acid (70 ml, 98 wt%) in an ice bath. Then potassium permanganate (9 g) was added to the suspension under stirring conditions and the temperature of the system was maintained at 283 K. (Notice: the reaction will get out of control if potassium permanganate was added quickly.) Later the ice bath was removed and the mixture was heated at 303 K for 10 h. Next 100 ml deionized water was carefully added dropwise to the container. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 363 K, then the resultant bright-yellow suspension was diluted and further treated with 30 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide. The mixture was followed by centrifugation and careful washing by hydrochloric acid and deionized water until near pH 7. The obtained product was dried under vacuum to remove the water (323 K).

Method of producing graphene:
Our CVD apparatus is equipped with four parallel microwave launchers having five slot antennas in each launcher. It has a substrate holder (400 mm × 600 mm), which enables the reciprocating motion of the substrate in order to deposit graphene on a large area with high uniformity. Graphene depositions were carried out by a two-step process. The first step was the plasma cleaning of the substrate surface, and the second step was graphene deposition. The substrates were mounted on the sample holder. The CVD chamber was evacuated using a turbo molecular pump. For plasma cleaning of the substrate a gas mixture of Ar and H2 was used, and the duration of the cleaning process was 20 min. After that, the chamber was evacuated once, and the graphene deposition process was performed using a CH4/H2/Ar plasma. Typical plasma conditions of the cleaning and deposition processes are listed as such: “ CH4/Ar/H2 flow rate (sccm) 30/20/50; Pressure (Pa) 30 ;Microwave power (kW) 16 ;Web flow rate (mm s−1) 5–10”. 
The substrates used in this study were rolled Cu foils (33µm in thickness) and rolled aluminium (Al) foils (12µm in thickness). The average surface roughness of the Cu substrate measured by AFM was about 1 nm and typical domain sizes of the Cu substrate area were in the range between 100 and 400µm. For graphene deposition by thermal CVD, a high-temperature heat treatment at around 1000 ◦C before graphene deposition was important to deposit high-quality graphene since the heat treatment leads to a highly (1 1 1) oriented Cu surface and enlarges the grain size. However, such phenomena were not observed after our plasma treatment in this study. Our plasma treatment enabled us to remove the contaminations and the oxides on the substrate surface. The temperature was measured by a thermo-couple. The substrate temperature was raised up to 245 ◦C by the plasma exposure during the pretreatment. The maximum substrate temperature during the deposition of graphene was about 320 ◦C."

Figure 1 illustrates the CVD reactor used in this work. The first high-temperature zone (the upstream one) was heated to 1050 ◦C and the second high-temperature zone (the downstream one) was heated to 1000 ◦C, while the temperature of the low-temperature zone (the middle region between the high-temperature zones) is ∼800 ◦C. In order to get a stable reaction atmosphere, a vacuum pump was used to remove the air inside the tube. As depicted in figure 1, two 8 × 12 cm2 strips of commercially available Cu foil of thickness 25 µm (99.8% purity) were respectively placed in the high-temperature zones and a SiO2 substrate (2 cm × 2 cm × 0.05 cm, with both sides polished) was spaced in the middle region of the low-temperature zone. Then the furnace was heated and pumped down to 1.0×10−6 Torr. The Cu foils surrounding the quartz tube were simultaneously annealed to 1000 ◦C in a 100 sccm H2 flow for 20 min to remove the remaining copper oxide. Subsequently, H2 (100 sccm) and CH4 (200 sccm) were supplied for 30 min growth. After growth, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature quickly by simply opening the furnace"

Method of producing graphene:
The electric arc oven for synthesis of graphene mainly comprises two electrodes and a steel chamber cooled by water. The cathode and anode were graphite rods (purity: 99.99%) with diameters of 8 and 6 mm, respectively. The current in the discharge process was maintained at 100 A. Initial air pressures from 400 to 1000 Torr were employed to investigate the influence of gas pressure. The pressure in the oven was increased to a certain level during the discharge process because of the heating effect. A 10 cm long anode graphite rod was consumed in a period of ~10 min. After the consumption of the anode, flue products deposited on the inner wall of the chamber were collected. Several tens of grams of products were obtained per day. Heat treatment in air was performed to purify the products. The sample was heated in air from "

Method of producing graphene:
The synthesis process of rice husk-derived graphene was performed in accordance with the process described by Muramatsu et al. (2014). 5 g of raw rice husk was grounded and treatment inside Carbolite furnace for 2 hours at 400 °C. The solid residue obtained were called as rice husk ash (RHA). Then, the RHA was chemically activated using KOH with impregnation ratio of 1:2 of KOH powder. The mixture was then compacted in a ceramic crucible. Next, the crucible was placed in the midpoint of a larger ceramic crucible. The empty space around ceramic crucible was fully covered by sufficiently pressing and packing the sacrificial RHA. The sacrificial RHA used to prevent oxidation on the mixture against air at high temperature. The crucibles were heated at 800°C for 2 hours. Treatment was carried out where the chemically activated RHA was poured in 50 ml deionized water (DI water) and stirred for 30 minutes to remove potassium ions residue. The sample was centrifuged at 3200 round per minutes (RPM) for 30 minutes. Then, the sample was sonicated in 100 ml of DI water for 3 minutes with amplitude of 50%. After that, the sample was rinsed in 50 ml DI water using vacuum filtration over a PTFE membrane with 0.22 mm pore size. Next, the sample was dried in vacuum oven for 24 hours at 80 °C to remove moisture.

Method of producing graphene:
Ambient-air thermal synthesis of grapheme. The growth of graphene was carried out in a thermal CVD furnace (OTF-1200X-UL, MTI Corp) with a quartz tube (100 cm in length, 5 cm in diameter). Polycrystalline Ni foils (25 mm, 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) were used as the growth substrate. Briefly, two alumina plates were placed in the heating zone of the furnace. One alumina plate was loaded with 0.14 ml of soybean oil precursor and the other was loaded with the Ni foil growth substrate. The openings of the quartz tube were then sealed. The growth of graphene proceeds with a gradual heating and fast quenching temperature profile. First, the furnace temperature was raised to 800oC at a rate of 30 oC /min. This was followed by holding at 800 oC for 3 min. After the growth step, the sample was immediately removed from the heating zone to enable a rapid cooling (at approximately 25 oC /min ) to segregate the homogeneous and continuous graphene films. Owing to the evaporation and thermal expansion of the precursor material, a small build-up in pressure within the tube was observed. Throughout the heating stage (200 to 800 oC), atmospheric pressure was maintained in the quartz tube by allowing this build-up of gases to exit via the exhaust of the tube. A controlled gas environment was created in the tube through enabling the circulation of gases produced by precursor evaporation. Following the heating stage, pressure within the quartz tube was observed to be stabilized at atmospheric pressure. No additional gases were introduced into the quartz tube throughout the entire growth process."

We annealed the Cu substrates for half an hour at 1035 °C before the growth. Hydrogen flow was kept constant during the heating, annealing, growth and cooling. After 10 minutes of growth, samples were left for fast cooling to room temperature. The growth took place in a 8 inch diameter quartz chamber.

Method of producing graphene:
Following Hummers’ method, suspensions of Graphene Oxide (GO) platelets were prepared. Thereafter, Ti3AlC2 was added to 20 mL solution of 9M HCl that contained 2g of LiF and the solution was stirred at 35 °C for 24 h. After completely reacting, the MXene(M) product was washed with deionized water for five cycles, which involved 5 min of centrifugation at 3500 rpm for each cycle. This produced a dark-green supernatant solution of M nanosheets having a pH of ≈7. After a final separation of M from the solution using the centrifuge, M was added to deionized water and sonicated for 1h in an ice bath. After centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 1h, the obtained exfoliated supernatant had a M concentration of ~1.0 mg/mL. MGO sheets were fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration. A solution containing the desired relative amounts of dispersed monolayer M and GO nanosheets was sonicated for 10 min. Afterwards, the solution was stirred for 6 h until reaction between M and GO nanosheets was completed. Then the MGO sheets were obtaind by vacuum-assisted filtration and dried in a vacuum at 60°C for 12h. The MGO sheets were reduced by HI for 6h, and then the sheets were immersed in ethanol at room temperature to remove unreacted HI. Six types of reduced MGO sheets were prepared by adjusting the weight ratio of monolayer MXene to GO platelets, and labelled MrGO-I, MrGO-II, MrGO-III, MrGO-IV, and MrGO-V (5.5, 9.9, 17.7, 29.9, and 45.1 wt%, respectively)."

Method of producing graphene:
In a typical procedure, 1 g of graphite flakes (99%, Alfa Aesar) was added to 50 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, Merck) while stirring in an ice-water bath. 3 g potassium permanganate (>99%, Sigma Aldrich) was gradually added by maintaining the temperature under 10 °C. Then, the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 25 min followed by 5 min sonication in an ultrasonic bath (SO-TEC, MUY-4). After repeating the stirring-sonication process for 12 times, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 200 mL distilled water. An extra 2h ultrasonic treatment was carried out before dividing the suspension into two equal parts; one washed to obtain graphene oxide(AGO)  (described later) and the other was further processed for preparation of reduced graphene oxide (ARGO). After adjusting the pH at ~6 by the addition of 1M sodium hydroxide (>98%, Sigma Aldrich) solution, the suspension was further sonicated for 1 h. 10 g L-ascorbic acid (99%, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 mL distilled water and then was slowly added to the exfoliated graphite oxide suspension at room temperature. The reduction was performed at 95 °C for 1 h. The resultant black precipitates were simply filtered by cellulose filter paper and further were washed with a 1M hydrochloric acid solution (37%, Merck) and distilled water to neutral pH. Finally, the filtrate was freeze-dried to obtain ARGO powder. The washing of AGO was adapted from a modified Hummers method. 20 mL hydrogen peroxide (30%, Merck) was added to the exfoliated graphite oxide suspension and stirred until gas evolution ceased. The AGO was washed with 1M hydrochloric acid solution and distilled water for several times each for 30 min by means of centrifugation (Ependorf, 5810-R) at 10000 rpm.

Method of producing graphene:
The catalyst preparation and ICP-CVD growth are both performed in a customized sputter/electron-beam/ICP-CVD cluster. First, 8-inch or 4-inch SiO2/Si (or quartz) wafers are sputtered with Cu films at 100–200oC. For face-to-face transfer, the wafers are pre-treated with N2 plasma (1,000 W, 50 mtorr). The conditions for ICP-CVD growth are as follows: the wafer with a sputtered Cu film is treated with a H2 plasma (150W) for 5 min with the substrate heated to 750 oC at 50 mtorr. A mixture of H2 and CH4 (5150:10) is introduced into the chamber for graphene growth (150W plasma power, 50 mtorr, 5 min). After growth, the graphene/ Cu/wafer is spin-coated with PMMA (996,000 relative molecular mass, 4 wt% in ethyl lactate, 3,000 r.p.m. for 1 min) for protection. A 0.1M ammonium persulphate ((NH4)2S2O8) aqueous solution or 1M iron chloride (FeCl3) is used as the etchant. Baking at 150 oC for 10 min is needed to evaporate the water layer. Finally, face-to-face transferred graphene on the wafer is realized by removing the PMMA with acetone."

Preparation of GO. Graphene Oxide (GO) was prepared by modified Hummers’ method. 5.0 g graphite, 2.5 g NaNO3, and 125 ml H2SO4 were loaded in a 1000 ml round-bottom flask with magnetic stirring. After being cooled with ice-water bath at 0 °C for 1 h, 17.5 g KMnO4 was added into above reaction system. After reaction was kept at 0–5 °C for 1 h and then heated at 35 °C for 2 h, the mixture was diluted with 250 ml deionized water and reacted at 98 °C for 45 min. 200 ml deionized water and 50 ml H2O2 (30%) were added into above suspension under the condition of magnetic stirring. After centrifugation and dry, GO was obtained.
Preparation of GOGA. Exfoliation of GO was obtained by ultrasonication in water for 2 h. GOGA was prepared in three steps: (1) 1.5 g gallic acid was loaded into 500 ml GO (5 mg/ml) solution, and the mixture was dispersed by ultrasound for 40 min. (2) the mixed solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 h. (3) The mixed solution was dried at 90 °C under air atmosphere for 24 h to obtain the mixture of gallic acid-modified GO (GOGA). 
Preparation of rGOGA. 3.0 g Magnesium powder and 1.5 g GOGA powder were mixed evenly. The mixture was put in a crucible, and mixture was covered with a thin layer of magnesium powder on the surface of mixture. Mixture was ignited by magnesium ribbon under air atmosphere condition. After the reaction is over, the mixed products were transferred to a beaker containing 250ml of 3M HCl. Products were transferred into the acid solution to remove MgO and residual Mg. The resulting rGOGA (reduced GOGA) was collected with filtration, washed with deionized water until the filtrate turned out to be of neutral.

Method of producing graphene:
To extract such 2D crystallites, we used a simple but effective procedure. A fresh surface of a layered crystal was rubbed against another surface (virtually any solid surface is suitable), which left a variety of flakes attached to it (the rubbing process can be described as similar to ‘‘drawing by chalk on a blackboard’’). Unexpectedly, among the resulting flakes we always found single layers. Their preliminary identification amid thicker flakes and other residue was done in an optical microscope. 2D crystallites become visible on top of an oxidized Si wafer, because even a monolayer adds up sufficiently to the optical path of reflected light so that the interference color changes with respect to the one of an empty substrate (phase contrast). The whole procedure takes literally half an hour to implement and identify probable 2D crystallites.

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene oxide was synthesized from natural graphite through the Hummers method which has been improved. The graphite is first pre-oxidized by mixing 5g graphite powder with concentrated sulfuric acid (12.5 mL), potassium persulfate (2.5 g) and phosphorus pentoxide (2.5g). The mixture was heated at 80oC for 6 hours. After dilution with 500 mL of H2O, the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. After that, the product is recovered by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with Nanopure water until the filtrate has a pH close to 7. The product obtained is then dried at room temperature for one day. Then, the pre-oxidized graphite is dispersed in H2SO4 (0 oC, 115 mL). The temperature of the mixture is carefully controlled to not exceed 10 oC. Subsequently, potassium permanganate (15 g) is gradually added with constant stirring for 1 hour. The dispersion is then incubated at 35 oC  for 2 h and this is followed by the addition of Nanopure water (225 mL) in small portions (15 mL) to control the temperature of the mixture, which must remain below 50 oC. To completely dissolve the KMnO4 , hydrogen peroxide (30%, 12.5 mL) was immediately added at the end of a second dilution (H2O, 700mL), and the mixture is stirred for 48 hours. Finally, the suspension is filtered, washed first with HCl (10%) to remove residual metal ions, and repeatedly with Nanopure water until the pH of filtrate becomes neutral. The filtrate is quickly tested by adding a few drops of 1 M NaOH to verify the presence of metal ions in GO. The product obtained (graphite oxide) is then dried in air. The resultant graphite oxide was dispersed in Nanopure water kept in the ultrasonic bath for 24 hours to maximize exfoliation. The reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is obtained by thermal reduction of GO in Ar/5% H2 at 800 oC for 2 h. The resulting RGO can be dispersed in water and the dispersion stayed stable for few hours."

Method of producing graphene:
Commercially, procured sulphur and tetraphenyltin powders (Shandong West Asia Chemical Industry Co., Ltd) are mixed thoroughly via grinding in 50: 50 wt.%, and the mixture is then gradually polymerized into graphene by thermal annealing at 650OC for 2h under an Ar atmosphere. Singlet S2 released from sulphur gradually captures the H atoms in the benzene rings of tetraphenyltin and generates H2S, thereby yielding graphene, H2S and SnS2. 
It was then heated to 2000 OC at a rate of 60 OC/h and held at 2000 OC for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere, the structural defects in graphene are healed and SnS2 is eliminated as a byproduct to yield an ensemble of few layer graphene microspheres (FLGMs). Interestingly, such ensembles can be readily used as electrode materials, and manufactured on a large scale; for example, at the laboratory scale we obtained ~5 g of FLGMs in a single run. All chemicals were used directly without further purification.

Method of producing graphene:
Diels-Alder reaction was used to bond tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) molecules onto the graphene layers of graphite to weaken the interlayer interactions and to improve the dispersibility of resulting graphene sheets. To increase the efficiency of Diels-Alder reaction, graphite was firstly treated with oleum into oleum-intercalated graphite (OIG). After Diels-Alder reaction, graphite-TCNE adduct was exfoliated by ultrasonication to form a stable dispersion of graphene adducts (GA) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The GA dispersion was then subjected to heating at 100 °C for 3h to perform retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The cleavage and removal of TCNE addends from GA led to the formation of high-quality eliminated GA (Ega) sheets dispersible in NMP. The process of producing high-quality graphene was traced by comparing the interlayer distances of graphite, OIG, GA and eGA. With the assistances of expanded interlayer distances and improved solvent affinity, the graphite flakes treated by oleum and TCNE can be mechanically exfoliated into GA sheets to form a stable dispersion in NMP.

Method of producing graphene:
Dispersions of graphene in aqueous surfactant solutions were prepared by shear mixing using a Silverson L5M rotor-stator mixer. A solution of sodium cholate (SC) in de-ionised water (1 g/L) was prepared and then added to natural flake at 100 g/L with a  volume of 1L. Graphene was exfoliated using a 32 mm rotor at 4500 rpm for 60 min. The resulting dispersion was left to settle overnight, and the supernatant discarded. Fresh surfactant solution was then added, and the exfoliation repeated as before. The dispersion was left to settle for several hours before subjecting the supernatant to the centrifugation-based size selection. To select nanosheets by size, we used controlled centrifugation with sequentially increasing rotation speeds as previously reported. An initial centrifugation at 1500rpm (240g, 2 h) was performed to remove unexfoliated material. The supernatant was subjected to further centrifugation at 2000rpm (425g, 2h). The sediment was collected in fresh water-SC (SC concentration 0.1 g/L to facilitate imaging), while the supernatant was subjected to further centrifugation at 2500rpm (665g, 2h). Again, the sediment was collected, and the supernatant centrifuged at higher rpm. This procedure was repeated for 3000rpm (958g, 2h), 5000rpm (2660g, 2h), 10000rpm (10 170g, 2h) and 18000rpm (32 600g, 2h) to yield samples with decreasing sizes in the respective sediments. Compared with a method based on taking the supernatant from a single step centrifugation, this produces dispersions with lower polydispersity. This greatly facilitates microscopic characterization required to accurately determine length and thickness. A Hettich Mikro 220R centrifuge equipped with a fixed angle rotor 1016 and sample aliquots of 10 mL was used for rotations up to 5000rpm. For the high-speed centrifugations, 1.5 mL vials and a rotor 1195-A was used. In the case of the analysis of the stock-like dispersion, the sample of Asbury graphite exfoliated in SC was centrifuged at 1 krpm (104g, 2 h) and the sediment discarded. We note that the removal of non-exfoliated graphite is required for the metrics to be applicable."

In a typical procedure, 50g of graphite flakes and 80g of oxalic acid (OA) were placed into stainless steel jar (2500 ml volume) containing 10 mm diameter of stainless steel balls used as grinding medium. The utilization of low diameter stainless steel balls are due to increase the impact and shear energy of the ball to powder and make a low dimensional interaction with graphite layers. Initially, the Dual-drive ball milling was executed at three different critical speeds (40%, 70%, and 98%). But the critical speed of 40% offers an efficient exfoliation with less defects than 70% and 98%. Accordingly, the optimized critical speed of 40% is adopted for the graphite exfoliation by shear force ball milling. The milling was carried out up to 20h and rest time was one hour per cycle. Then, the milled graphite was treated with 1M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) to acidify the carboxylates and to remove the Iron impurities from milling jar in the milled graphite. Then, the mixture was washed with distilled water for several times until the pH becomes neutral. The mixture was filtered and subjected to the heat treatment at 600oC under an argon atmosphere for an appropriate time interval. Finally, as-prepared graphene was stored for prior use."

In this work, stainless steel (150 meshes, NE Scientific Co., Malaysia) that comprised of 50-um diameter fibres was purchased and applied as a substrate to synthesize the graphitic structures on its surface. The composition of the SS mesh was obtained by using EDX and is given in the following: C 0 wt%, Si 0.53 wt%, Cr 19.10 wt%, Ni 8.6 wt%, and Fe 70.3 wt%, while the rest had been related to other components. The pristine SS mesh was cut into a circle shape with 2-cm diameter and immersed into 9 M sulfuric acid solution for a few minutes to pretreat the SS surface. After that, the SS mesh was immersed into 50 mM Cu(NO3)2.3H2O solution and sonicated for 2 h to coat the surface of SS with Cu particles. The EDX results of SS mesh coated with Cu are as follows: C 0%, O 5.3%, Si 0.21%, Cr 10.2%, Ni 5.2%, Fe 46.2%, and Cu 32.2%, while the remaining weight was related to other components. The presence of oxygen was associated with the elemental composition of Cu nitrate trihydrate. Besides, when the SS mesh was placed into the CVD reactor and the temperature was increased to 300 °C, the nitrate compound was removed. To synthesize the graphene, pure acetylene (C2H2) was used as the hydrocarbon source, while nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) were utilized as the carrier gases. Next, the reaction temperature and the time in the CVD technique were altered to grow the graphene with different layers. First, the SS mesh was located in the CVD chamber, and then, the temperature was increased (950, 1000, and 1050 °C) under the flow of N2 gas. When the system reached the required temperature, the acetylene gas as a carbon source was inserted into the system at 50 sccm with the presence of H2/N2 flow (10 ssm/50 sccm), for different run times from 10 to 50 min. Finally, the C2H2 flow rate was stopped, and the furnace was turned off under the presence of N2 flow."

Method of producing graphene:
The expanded graphite (EG) with different concentrations (1.0 mg/mL) was dispersed in the liquid phase, i.e. distilled water and aqueous solution of ammonia (33 wt.% ). The dispersion was homogenized by sonication in a low-power sonic bath for 30 min. The sediment was separated by filtration and dried before further processing. The microwave experiments were carried out on a Mars (CEM Corp.) microwave oven with the following characteristics: adjustable power between 300 and 1200 W and maximum temperature of 250 ° C. The microwave irradiation was set at 300 W, keeping the temperature between 120 and 200 ° C for 60–120 min. The few layered graphene (FLG) sheets were formed as a suspension in the aqueous phase above the solid residual EG. In order to extract as much as possible of the FLG from the starting EG, the mixture was sonicated for 30 min followed by a decantation step. In the case of pure water as a solvent, the colourless suspension of the graphene sheets was separated from the starting EG by decantation or extraction with a toluene–ammonia (aq.) system, due to the low concentration of the FLG material in the solution."

Method of producing graphene:
Briefly, a direct current (DC) arc-discharge was carried out in a home-made water-cooled stainless steel chamber filled with a mixture of carbon dioxide and helium. Different buffer gas compositions, ranging from 5 vol% to 40 vol% CO2, and direct currents of 100 to 200 A were employed for the purposes of comparison. The discharge voltage was kept around 30 V by controlling the distance between the two electrodes. Both electrodes were normal graphite rods obtained commercially, with an anode diameter of 13 mm and a cathode diameter of 40 mm. After discharge, the cotton-like deposition product that formed on the inner wall of the chamber was collected and examined. The optimized conditions for the production of few layered graphene were found to be as follows: a low voltage (<35v), a high buffer gas pressure (>1270 Torr), high current (about 150 A) and 25%–40% (v/v) CO2 in the total buffer gas.

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene Oxide (GO) was synthesized from graphite powder using modified Hummer’s method. In brief, 1 g of graphite and 0.5 g of sodium nitrate were mixed followed by the addition of 23 ml of conc. sulphuric acid under constant stirring. After 1 h, 3 g of KMnO4 was added gradually to the above solution while keeping the temperature less than 20oC to prevent overheating and explosion. The mixture was stirred at 35 oC for 1 h and the resulting solution was diluted by adding 500 ml of water under vigorous stirring. To ensure the completion of reaction with KMnO4, the suspension was further treated with 30% H2O2 solution (5 ml). The resulting mixture was washed with HCl and H2O followed by filtration and drying, the GO sheets were thus obtained. GO (5 mg) was dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol–water (1: 1) mixture using ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The dispersion was transferred into a glass bottle fitted with a septum. The dissolved oxygen was removed by bubbling nitrogen gas for 10 min. The samples were irradiated in a 60Co gamma-ray source at a dose rate of 0.24 kGy h−1 for different doses (2.88– 14.40 kGy). The product so obtained was collected and washed with Milli-Q water and dried under vacuum. Similar procedure was adopted for other alcohols."

Method of producing graphene:
After cleaning, copper substrates were placed into a quartz boat and introduced in a cylindrical quartz reactor (inner diameter of 25 mm and 1 m-length) within a tube furnace. The quartz reactor was maintained at an initial vacuum of 10^-2 Torr using a mechanical pump. The temperature was risen to 950°C, at a rate of 30°C/min (Guermoune et al., 2011). Samples were maintained at this temperature for 26 min, using an H2 constant flow of 10 sccm to remove possible organic impurities. After the first 20 min of this step, a flow mixture of N2 gas and ethanol vapor (30 sccm), previously generated by an overpressure of N2, was introduced into the reactor. In this moment, a blue plasma discharge was generated. At the same time, the reactor pressure increases to 102 Torr during a few seconds until the pressure stabilizes at 1 Torr. Once the growth time finishes, a cooling process takes place. During the first 30 min of the cooling step, a constant flow of H2 10 sccm is maintained and, after that, an Ar flow of 300 sccm is introduced into the reactor."

Method of producing graphene:
30 in. Cu foil was wrapped onto an inner quartz tube with a diameter of ≈7.5 in., which was then loaded inside an outer 8 in. quartz tube. Graphene growth was conducted at 1000 °C using LPCVD after annealing in a H2 atmosphere. This process allowed the radial inhomogeneity in the reaction temperature and gas flow to be minimized. Very high-quality monolayer graphene was produced with a transmittance of 97.4% and sheet resistance as low as ≈125ohm−1."

Method of producing graphene:
Graphene was exfoliated from graphite using a high shear mixer (Silverson L5M-A)with a square hole high shear screen. Ethyl cellulose (EC) (Sigma–Aldrich, 4 cP grade as measured at 5% in 80:20 toluene: ethanol, 48% ethoxy) was dissolved in ethanol (Koptec, 200 proof) at a concentration of 0.2–2% w/v, and flake graphite (Asbury Graphite Mills, Grade 3061) was added at 10% w/v. This mixture was shear mixed for 2 h at 10,230 rpm in an ice bath, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm (≈3000 g ) for 2 h to sediment out large graphite flakes (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XPI centrifuge). The supernatant containing graphene, EC, and ethanol was harvested by pipette. For the flocculation step, this supernatant was mixed in a 16:9 wt. ratio with an aqueous NaCl solution (0.04 g/mL NaCl, Sigma–Aldrich, >99.5%) and centrifuged for 6 min at 7500 rpm (≈10 000 g ) to sediment the graphene/ EC composite. This sediment was washed with deionized water, collected by vacuum filtration (Millipore Nitrocellulose HAWP 0.45 μm filter paper), and then dried to yield the graphene/EC powder, with a graphene content of 25–65 wt% depending on the starting EC loading."

Method of producing graphene:
Natural graphite flake (20.0 g, Asbury Graphite Mills, 3061 Grade) was dispersed in a solution of ethyl cellulose (EC) in ethanol (0.1% w/v dispersion, 200 mL; EC: Aldrich, viscosity 4 cP, 5% in toluene/ethanol 80:20, 48% ethoxy; ethanol: Koptec, 200 proof) in a stainless steel beaker. A probe sonication system (Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, 13 mm Branson tip) was used to sonicate the dispersion for 105 min at 50 W in an ice water bath to exfoliate graphene sheets. The resulting dispersion was centrifuged (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XPI) at 5000 rpm (≈4500 g) for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. This dispersion was further centrifuged at 7500 rpm (≈10 000 g) for 15 min, and the sediment was collected. The wet sediment was redispersed with ethanol (25 mL ethanol per 1.0 g sediment) and EC (100 mg EC per 2.0 g sediment; EC: Aldrich, viscosity 22 cP, 5% in toluene/ethanol 80:20, 48% ethoxy) by bath sonication for 3 h. This dispersion was passed through a 3.1-μm-glass fiber filter membrane (Acrodisc). It was then mixed with an aqueous solution of NaCl (0.04 g mL−1, Sigma–Aldrich, >99.5%) in a 16:9 weight ratio and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 8 min, after which the supernatant was removed. To remove residual salt, the resulting graphene-EC solid was suspended in water, bath sonicated for 20 min, and collected by centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min. This isolated graphene-EC composite was then dried to yield a powder."

Method of producing graphene:
25 μm thick copper foils (Alfa Aesar 99.999%) were annealed for 10 minutes at 1035oC in a H2 atmosphere to increase the Cu grain size.  A constant flow rate of 0.4sccm of H2 and 1.4sccm of CH4 was used for all growths.  A typical processing for the growth of continuous graphene films involves the following steps: (1) heating up the CVD system from room temperature to the growth temperature, (2) Cu foil annealing, (3) graphene nucleation and growth, (4) cooling down the system to room temperature (see Figure S5).  During the heating up stage H2 gas was flown at a rate of 0.4sccm with a chamber pressure of 0.01 Torr. The annealing step was performed for 10 minutes at 1035oC in a H2 atmosphere, keeping the H2 gas flow rate at 0.4sccm and the chamber pressure of 0.01 Torr. The temperature was then lowered at 1000oC for the growth of continuous graphene films. A constant flow rate of 0.4sccm of H2 was kept throughout the nucleation and growth. For the nucleation stage, 1.4sccm of CH4 was introduced for 40 seconds. This was followed by the growth stage where the CH4 flow rate was increased to 7sccm for 300 seconds. Finally, the system was cooled down at room temperature keeping the H2 gas flow rate at 0.4sccm.

Method of producing graphene:
The dispersion of Sigma Aldrich graphite exfoliated in a kitchen blender with fairy liquid as stabilizer was produced as follows: Flake graphite was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Product no. 332461) and used as supplied. The surfactant used was Fairy washing-up liquid (Fairy Liquid, FL), a common household dishwashing liquid, with a composition of 15–30% anionic surfactants, 5–15% non-ionic surfactants (specified by the manufacturer, Proctor & Gamble). A Kenwood kitchen blender (model BL 370) was used. 2.5 g L−1 of FL was dissolved in deionized water and graphite (20 g L−1 ) was added to the tapered blender jug and FL/water solution poured in on top. The blender was operated at full speed for 60 min. Such blenders are not designed for continuous operation at high speeds for long times due to excess heating. To counter this, the mixer was turned off for one minute after every minute of mixing (1 min on/1 min off duty cycle). The jug was kept in an ice bath during the off cycles. The resultant dispersion was left to settle overnight prior to centrifugation. The FLG sedimenting between 1.5 krpm (240g) and 7.5 krpm (5400g) was collected in deionized water and subjected to analysis.

Method of producing graphene:
Porous graphene (pGRF) was prepared by using oxometalates (OM where M=Mo, W, Al, Mn, Sn, Ti or V) as the etching agents. Aqueous graphene oxide (GO) dispersion was prepared by the modified Hummers’ method. OM (1.13 mmol) was added into aqueous GO dispersion (4mg ml−1, 50ml), and the mixture was sonicated for 0.5h and was stirred overnight. The homogeneous mixture was freeze-dried to obtain solid GO-OM, which was then heated at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 to 650°C for 2h and cooled down to room temperature in the atmosphere of nitrogen. The obtained black product, named as GOM, was immersed in aqueous HCl solution (1M) and stirred for a week to remove the metal-containing species, such as metal oxides. Finally, pGRF sample was collected by filtration, washing with water and ethanol, and drying at 60°C in vacuum. The final product was named as pGRF-M (M=Mo, W, Al, Mn, Sn, Ti or V)."
