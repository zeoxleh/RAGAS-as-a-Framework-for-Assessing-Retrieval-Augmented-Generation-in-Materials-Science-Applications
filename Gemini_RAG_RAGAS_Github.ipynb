Rajendra Kumar\\n\\nDoi:\\n10.1039/C5RA24810H\\n\\nMethod of producing graphene:\\nIn a typical procedure, 50g of graphite flakes and 80g of oxalic acid (OA) were placed into stainless steel jar (2500 ml volume) containing 10 mm diameter of stainless steel balls used as grinding medium. The utilization of low diameter stainless steel balls are due to increase the impact and shear energy of the ball to powder and make a low dimensional interaction with graphite layers. Initially, the Dual-drive ball milling was executed at three different critical speeds (40%, 70%, and 98%). But the critical speed of 40% offers an efficient exfoliation with less defects than 70% and 98%. Accordingly, the optimized critical speed of 40% is adopted for the graphite exfoliation by shear force ball milling. The milling was carried out up to 20h and rest time was one hour per cycle. Then, the milled graphite was treated with 1M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) to acidify the carboxylates and to remove the Iron impurities from milling jar in the milled graphite. Then, the mixture was washed with distilled water for several times until the pH becomes neutral. The mixture was filtered and subjected to the heat treatment at 600oC under an argon atmosphere for an appropriate time interval. Finally, as-prepared graphene was stored for prior use.\",\n          \"Author:\\nFatima Tuz Johra\\n\\nDOI:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiec.2013.11.022\\n\\nMethod of producing graphene:\\nGraphene oxide was prepared from graphite flakes(40mm) via an improved Hummers\\u2019 method. A mixture of H2SO4(95%) and H3PO4(85%) in a 9:1 vol. equiv.ratio. was added to a mixture of KMnO4 and graphite flakes (3:1 wt. equiv.). Because of heat evolution from the exothermic process, a delay (15\\u201320 min) was introduced to bring the temperature down to room temperature. The mixture was then placed on a heating mantle at 50oC, with constant stirring for 12 h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured onto ice [400 mL of deionized (DI) water were used to make the ice] with 30% H2O2 (3 mL). The solution was then sieved using a testing sieve and the filtrate was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4h). The supernatant was then discarded, and the remaining solid was sequentially washed with water, 30% HCl, and ethanol (twice in each case); for each wash, the mixture was sifted through the sieve and the filtrate was then centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4h) using a Mega 17R small, high-speed, refrigerated centrifuge machine, and the supernatant was decanted. After the multiple washing treatments, the remaining materials were coagulated using ethyl ether and then filtered through a PTFE membrane with a micropore size of 0.2 mm, followed by drying in vacuum. Graphene oxide was placed in a beaker and sonicated with DI water (0.1 mg mL1) for 5 min, using an ultrasonicator. 2-4ml of NH4OH (25\\u201330%) were added to adjust the pH to 11. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 180oC for 6h. After completion of the reaction, this solution was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4 h), and the obtained materials were washed with DI water and ethanol (twice in each case) to remove impurities.

The quartz reactor was maintained at an initial vacuum of 10^-2 Torr using a mechanical pump. The temperature was risen to 950°C, at a rate of 30°C/min (Guermoune et al., 2011). Samples were maintained at this temperature for 26 min, using an H2 constant flow of 10 sccm to remove possible organic impurities. After the first 20 min of this step, a flow mixture of N2 gas and ethanol vapor (30 sccm), previously generated by an overpressure of N2, was introduced into the reactor. In this moment, a blue plasma discharge was generated. At the same time, the reactor pressure increases to 102 Torr during a few seconds until the pressure stabilizes at 1 Torr. Once the growth time finishes, a cooling process takes place. During the first 30 min of the cooling step, a constant flow of H2 10 sccm is maintained and, after that, an Ar flow of 300 sccm is introduced into the reactor.\n",

A continuous wave (CW) Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was focused on the S-1805 film through the transparent quartz substrate using a lens of 150 mm focal length. The carbon atoms were decomposed from the laser heated photoresist, then dissolved in the molten quartz, and extracted to form graphene when the temperature of quartz was decreased.

Briefly, 5 g carbonized powder, 30 g KMnO4 and 5 g NaNO3 were slowly added into 220 ml concentrated H2SO4 in sequence and vigorously stirred in an ice bath for 10 h. The mixture was then heated to 35 °C and maintained for 3 h with continuous stirring. The mixture was then diluted by 440 ml distilled water, and the temperature of mixture was controlled to be under 85 °C during the dilution process. After that, H2O2 (30 wt%) was added into the mixture drop by drop until the color of solution became bright yellow. The mixture was finally centrifuged (8000 rpm, 6 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining solid was then successively washed with 1 M HCl solution and deionized water several times by centrifugation until the pH of the solution was neutral. The obtained solid was ultrasonicated in deionized water for 8 h, and the resultant suspension was then dried by freeze drying to obtain graphene oxide. For the thermal exfoliation-reduction of graphene oxide process, 1 g of obtained graphene oxide was placed in a quartz crucible (with a lid) and heated at 900 °C for 5 min in a muffle furnace under nitrogen atmosphere. The graphene nanosheets were collected after a natural cooling.\n",

Briefly, graphite powder (2 g) was stirred in 98% H2SO4 (35 mL) for 2 h. KMnO4 (6 g) was gradually added to the above solution while keeping the temperature less than 20oC. The mixture was then stirred at 35–40 oC for 30 min. The resulting solution was diluted by adding 90 mL of water under vigorous stirring and a dark brown color suspension was obtained. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 mL of distilled water and 30% H2O2 solution (10 mL). After continuously stirred for 2 h, the mixture was washed by repeated centrifugation and filtration using 5% HCl aqueous solution in order to remove the residual metal ions. Further, the centrifugation process was repeated with distilled water until the pH of the solution becomes neutral. Finally, a brown colored precipitate of graphitic oxide was obtained by filtration and was allowed to dry under vacuum. The exfoliation of graphitic oxide into graphene oxide was achieved by ultrasound irradiation. Briefly, 0.2 g of as-synthesized graphitic oxide was redispersed in 200 mL of distilled water and allowed to sonication for 30 min which results in exfoliation of graphitic oxide into monolayers of graphene oxide (GO) and is further used for the synthesis of graphene.\n",

Briefly, 5 g carbonized powder, 30 g KMnO4 and 5 g NaNO3 were slowly added into 220 ml concentrated H2SO4 in sequence and vigorously stirred in an ice bath for 10 h. The mixture was then heated to 35 °C and maintained for 3 h with continuous stirring. The mixture was then diluted by 440 ml distilled water, and the temperature of mixture was controlled to be under 85 °C during the dilution process. After that, H2O2 (30 wt%) was added into the mixture drop by drop until the color of solution became bright yellow. The mixture was finally centrifuged (8000 rpm, 6 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining solid was then successively washed with 1 M HCl solution and deionized water several times by centrifugation until the pH of the solution was neutral. The obtained solid was ultrasonicated in deionized water for 8 h, and the resultant suspension was then dried by freeze drying to obtain graphene oxide. For the thermal exfoliation-reduction of graphene oxide process, 1 g of obtained graphene oxide was placed in a quartz crucible (with a lid) and heated at 900 °C for 5 min in a muffle furnace under nitrogen atmosphere. The graphene nanosheets were collected after a natural cooling.\n",

The mixture was then stirred at 35–40 oC for 30 min. The resulting solution was diluted by adding 90 mL of water under vigorous stirring and a dark brown color suspension was obtained. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 mL of distilled water and 30% H2O2 solution (10 mL). After continuously stirred for 2 h, the mixture was washed by repeated centrifugation and filtration using 5% HCl aqueous solution in order to remove the residual metal ions. Further, the centrifugation process was repeated with distilled water until the pH of the solution becomes neutral. Finally, a brown colored precipitate of graphitic oxide was obtained by filtration and was allowed to dry under vacuum. The exfoliation of graphitic oxide into graphene oxide was achieved by ultrasound irradiation. Briefly, 0.2 g of as-synthesized graphitic oxide was redispersed in 200 mL of distilled water and allowed to sonication for 30 min which results in exfoliation of graphitic oxide into monolayers of graphene oxide (GO) and is further used for the synthesis of graphene.\n",

An aqueous solution containing ammonium sulphate with TEMPO was tested as an electrolyte. Before exfoliation, the graphite foil was pretreated by alternately soaking it in liquid nitrogen and absolute ethanol. During this process, violent nitrogen evolution and ethanol solidification promoted the expansion of the graphite foils. The dilation was extremely rapid (within 10 s) and yielded a drastic volume increase at the graphite boundary (∼10 times), which facilitated the expansion of the graphite layers, as did the following anion intercalation steps. When the graphite anodes were immersed in the electrolyte, by applying a static bias of 10 V, they detached into small pieces in less than 10 s, spreading on top of the electrolyte and/or on the bottom of the electrochemical cell. After filtration and copious washing, these exfoliated graphene sheets were collected and then dispersed in DMF via mild sonication.

            "The process was carried out at home-made cold-wall reactor apparatus consisting of a RTP system (RTP1000, Ecopia) and a modified gas supply. Prior to CVD, the Ni foil (thickness: 25 um, purity: 99.99%) was placed in a reaction ion etching system   (etch time 30 min, RF power 100 W, Ar gas flow 100 sccm, gas pressure 2 Pa) to create a fresh Ni surface. The Ar plasma treated Ni foils was immediately loaded onto the PG (Pyrolytic Graphite)/PBN (Pyrolytic Boron Nitride) heater stage. The reaction chamber was pumped down to 3 mTorr using a rotary vacuum pump. The Ni foil was heated up to 1000 degree Celsius at a 100 degree Celsius /min heating rate, and maintained for 30 min in the N2/H2 atmosphere (N2:H2 = 700:100 sccm, total pressure 4.5 Torr). Subsequently, the CVD growth of graphene was triggered by the addition of CH4 (8 sccm) along with N2 (700 sccm) and H2 (100 sccm) to maintain 20 Torr of the chamber pressure. After CVD growth, the samples were cooled down from 1000 to 500oC with a consistent cooling rate of 200oC /min, under a flow of N2 (700 sccm). After CVD growth, the as-grown graphene films were transferred to different target substrates using the following method. First, a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated onto the as-grown graphene at 500 rpm for 5 s first, then 2500 rpm for 20 s. The PMMA/graphene/Ni foil was cured at 180 oC for 1 min, and subsequently, the rear side of the Ni foil was polished to remove the coatings. The graphene/PMMA film was released from the Ni foil by chemical etching of Ni with a FeCl3 (1 M) solution over a period of 24 h, followed by rinsing with de-ionized water. The floating PMMA supported-graphene was transferred onto arbitrary substrates such as a SiO2/Si substrate and a flexible transparent PET substrate (0.125 mm thick film). Finally, PMMA was dissolved by acetone. Produced mono-layer graphene\n",

            "Oxidation of graphite: firstly, 1 g graphite powders (the mean diameter of 18 mm provided by Mei Ge Electrical Carbon Co., Ltd. China) were poured into the mixture of 92 mL concentrated sulfuric acid (95–98%) and 24 mL nitric acid (65%) in a 500 mL flask(under ice bath). After the suspended solution was strongly stirred at 0oC for 15 min. Then 6 g KMnO4 (AR) was gradually added in the above mixture solution. The suspended solution was stirred continuously for 1 h. We called this process low temperature oxidation. Subsequently, in order to increase the oxidation degree of the graphite, the mixture was heated to 80 oC for 30 min, and then 92 mL of deionized water was slowly added in. The suspension was stirred at 80 oC for 30 min again. After that, 5 mL H2O2 (30%) was added into the solution to reduce the residual permanganate. On completion of the reaction, the mixture was washed with 5% solution of HCl and water until sulfate could not be detected with BaCl2. Finally, the GO powders were dried at 80 oC for 24 h. The dosage of oxidizer was controlled to produce oxidized graphite of different degrees. 2.1.2. Expansion of GO In this step, the obtained GO powders (400 mg) were loaded in a quartz boat. The quartz boat was placed into a 25-mm internal diameter; 1-m long quartz tube. After the sample was flushed with argon for 30 min (the velocity of argon is 100 mL/min ), the quartz tube was heated to 300 oC for 1 h (at heating rates of 15 oC/min) in tube furnace under argon flow. 2.1.3. Reduction of EG Graphene sheets obtained from thermal expansion contain residual H and OH groups. Therefore, to remove H and OH groups, the as-prepared EG were reduced in a tube furnace by H2 (the gas flow is consisted of H2 (40 mL/min) and argon (60 mL/min)) for 2 h at 500 oC. After the GS was dispersed into ethanol, to remove a small amount of precipitate, post-treatment of sonication and centrifugation is used and then the desired graphene sheets are collected for further characterizations.\n",

Briefly, the pH of the as exfoliated GO solution (0.2 g in 200 mL) was adjusted to reach 10 by NaOH solution followed by the addition of 2 mL of hydrazine and the entire reaction is subjected to ultrasound irradiation for 2 h. The sonication reaction was conducted without any cooling, so that a temperature of about 60 ± 5oC was reached at the end of the reaction. The experiment is performed under atmospheric conditions. The obtained graphene nanosheets was washed thoroughly with distilled water and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min in order to remove the residuals. The procedure was repeated for several times until the synthesized product becomes free from trace amount of impurities. Further, the synthesized graphene nanosheets were dried in a hot air oven and were used for further characterization.

Briefly, the pH of the as exfoliated GO solution (0.2 g in 200 mL) was adjusted to reach 10 by NaOH solution followed by the addition of 2 mL of hydrazine and the entire reaction is subjected to ultrasound irradiation for 2 h. The sonication reaction was conducted without any cooling, so that a temperature of about 60 ± 5oC was reached at the end of the reaction. The experiment is performed under atmospheric conditions. The obtained graphene nanosheets was washed thoroughly with distilled water and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min in order to remove the residuals. The procedure was repeated for several times until the synthesized product becomes free from trace amount of impurities.

Detailed steps are as follows: the raw material was first cut into small pieces (approximately 3 cm in length) and washed with distilled water, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h before use. Within the subsequent hydrothermal treatment, 4 g of the washed wheat straw was immersed in a 400 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave wherein 280 mL of homogeneous 3 M KOH solution was contained, and then the autoclave was heated at a temperature of 150 °C for 6 h. When cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resulting samples were fetched out, collected by vacuum filtration with quantitative filter paper, washed by ultrasonication in 120 mL deionized water for 30 min and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The following high temperature pyrolysis and chemically activation was carried out at 800 °C for 3 h under the protection of N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a N2 flow rate of 150 cm3 min−1 . After that, the carbonaceous product was thoroughly washed with 0.5 M HCl solution to remove the residual KOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the asprepared product was thermally treated at 2600 °C for 5 min using a graphite furnace in an argon atmosphere. The typical yield of fewlayer graphene by using wheat straw as starting material was found to be ca. 11.3 wt.%.\n",

Detailed steps are as follows: the raw material was first cut into small pieces (approximately 3 cm in length) and washed with distilled water, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h before use. Within the subsequent hydrothermal treatment, 4 g of the washed wheat straw was immersed in a 400 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave wherein 280 mL of homogeneous 3 M KOH solution was contained, and then the autoclave was heated at a temperature of 150 °C for 6 h. When cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resulting samples were fetched out, collected by vacuum filtration with quantitative filter paper, washed by ultrasonication in 120 mL deionized water for 30 min and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The following high temperature pyrolysis and chemically activation was carried out at 800 °C for 3 h under the protection of N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and a N2 flow rate of 150 cm3/min . After that, the carbonaceous product was thoroughly washed with 0.5 M HCl solution to remove the residual KOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the asprepared product was thermally treated at 2600 °C for 5 min using a graphite furnace in an argon atmosphere. The typical yield of fewlayer graphene by using wheat straw as starting material was found to be ca. 11.3 wt.%.'],\n",

            "Monolayer graphene was synthesized using thermal CVD. First, a copper (Cu) foil (10 × 10 cm2) was placed in a quartz tube and heated to 1000 °C for 60 min with flowing H2 at 10 sccm. Then, a gas mixture of 45 sccm CH4 and 10 sccm H2 flowed for 30 min under 10 Torr. After 30 min, the heater was turned off and removed from the Cu foil. Next, to handle the monolayer graphene on the front side of the Cu foil, a protective layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated on the graphene on the front side of the Cu foil, and the graphene on the back was removed using oxygen plasma (100 W RF power, 12 s). Then, the PMMA film on the graphene was removed using acetone, and the remaining Cu was etched away using a 0.1 M ammonium persulfate solution. Finally, the monolayer graphene was rinsed in deionized water and transferred onto a p-type silicon substrate without a silicon oxide layer. For the various stacked graphene layers, graphene with PMMA was floated on deionized water and transferred onto another graphene layer on Cu and etched/rinsed again. The transfer and etching/rinsing procedure was repeated for up to 4 layers of graphene. To synthesize graphene with defects, the monolayer graphene on the back side of the copper was removed using oxygen plasma, and the graphene on the front side of the Cu was treated with argon plasma (10 W RF power, 4 s). The PMMA layer was coated onto this graphene, and the Cu foil was removed. Then, the treated graphene was transferred onto silicon or used in the stacking process.\n",

            "The synthesis process of rice husk-derived graphene was performed in accordance with the process described by Muramatsu et al. (2014). 5 g of raw rice husk was grounded and treatment inside Carbolite furnace for 2 hours at 400 °C. The solid residue obtained were called as rice husk ash (RHA). Then, the RHA was chemically activated using KOH with impregnation ratio of 1:2 of KOH powder. The mixture was then compacted in a ceramic crucible. Next, the crucible was placed in the midpoint of a larger ceramic crucible. The empty space around ceramic crucible was fully covered by sufficiently pressing and packing the sacrificial RHA. The sacrificial RHA used to prevent oxidation on the mixture against air at high temperature. The crucibles were heated at 800°C for 2 hours. Treatment was carried out where the chemically activated RHA was poured in 50 ml deionized water (DI water) and stirred for 30 minutes to remove potassium ions residue. The sample was centrifuged at 3200 round per minutes (RPM) for 30 minutes. Then, the sample was sonicated in 100 ml of DI water for 3 minutes with amplitude of 50%. After that, the sample was rinsed in 50 ml DI water using vacuum filtration over a PTFE membrane with 0.22 mm pore size. Next, the sample was dried in vacuum oven for 24 hours at 80 °C to remove moisture.\n",

            "Graphene film synthesis was performed in a SEKI AX5200S MPCVD system with H2 (50 sccm) and CH4 (5 sccm) as the feed gases. A 25 um thick copper foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.8% purity) was used as the substrate. The foil was cut in 2 · 2 cm2 pieces and placed into the MPCVD chamber, which was evacuated to a base pressure of 2 Torr and then filled with high-purity hydrogen at a pressure of 10 Torr. The Cu foil was supported by a ceramic stand that elevated it from the Mo puck by about 15 mm. The elevation of the Cu foil above Mo puck was found to be critical for the growth of the films because it ensures a strong coupling between the plasma and the Cu foil, thus enabling rapid self-heating of the foil by the microwave plasma. No additional heater was used. The thermocouple attached to the substrate table indicated a maximum reading of approximately 65oC during the process. A dual-wavelength infrared pyrometer indicated a maximum temperature of 700 ± 25 oC. However, as the copper foil is coated with graphene, the surface emissivity changes, making reliable IR measurements difficult. The entire growth is accomplished in less than 5 min and generally involves two stages. First, in a plasma cleaning and annealing step, the foil is kept in 400 W hydrogen plasma for 3 min. A H2 flow rate of 50 sccm was used with downstream pressure control to maintain 10 Torr chamber pressure throughout the process. This process leads to rapid self-heating and removal of copper oxide from the foil surface. The second stage involves introduction of CH4 (while maintaining the hydrogen plasma) at a flow of 5 sccm for a short duration (between 30 s and 2 min), providing approximately 10% CH4 concentration in hydrogen. Depending on the growth duration and whether or not annealing is used, different forms of carbon can be deposited\n",

The first high-temperature zone (the upstream one) was heated to 1050 ◦C and the second high-temperature zone (the downstream one) was heated to 1000 ◦C, while the temperature of the low-temperature zone (the middle region between the high-temperature zones) is ∼800 ◦C. In order to get a stable reaction atmosphere, a vacuum pump was used to remove the air inside the tube. As depicted in figure 1, two 8 × 12 cm2 strips of commercially available Cu foil of thickness 25 µm (99.8% purity) were respectively placed in the high-temperature zones and a SiO2 substrate (2 cm × 2 cm × 0.05 cm, with both sides polished) was spaced in the middle region of the low-temperature zone. Then the furnace was heated and pumped down to 1.0×10−6 Torr. The Cu foils surrounding the quartz tube were simultaneously annealed to 1000 ◦C in a 100 sccm H2 flow for 20 min to remove the remaining copper oxide. Subsequently, H2 (100 sccm) and CH4 (200 sccm) were supplied for 30 min growth. After growth, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature quickly by simply opening the furnace\n",

A quartz tube with 2 diameter was used as the reaction chamber for our CVD system. Cu foils were rolled up in a roll, but without the rolled-up layers touching to each other. Following the growth, PMMA was spun on graphene/Cu substrate to form PMMA/graphene/Cu sandwich structure. Later, Cu foil was etched away using an iron nitrate aqua solution. After the Cu foil was completely etched away, graphene with PMMA/graphene film was transferred onto a Si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2. The PMMA was then removed by repeatedly rinsing the film in acetone.\n",

            "A horizontal AP-CVD system with a quartz tube of length 90 cm and diameter of 50 mm was taken as the reactor placed in two split furnaces. Cu foil (Nilaco Corp.) of thickness 20 μm and purity 99.99% was used as substrate for graphene synthesis. Solid waste plastic used for material packaging is used as carbon source in these studies. Cu foil was cleaned by sonicating in acetone for 30 min and placed in the growth furnace without further treatment. Cu substrate was annealed for 30 min in 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of H2 at 1020 °C before the feedstock was introduced. Annealing is an important step to enlarge Cu grain size, reduce lattice mismatch and dislocations, which help to limit number of nucleation sites. 3 mg of waste plastic as carbon source was placed in a ceramic boat inside the lower temperature furnace. Graphene growth was carried out for 90 minutes using a gas mixture of Ar and H2 with the flow rate 98 and 2.5 sccm, respectively. Supply of precursor was continuously increased during the growth process to provide sufficient carbon atoms for uninterrupted growth of graphene crystal. The injection rate of polymeric components contained in the waste plastic was changed by the rate of evaporation. Thereafter, it was allowed to cool at a cooling rate of (~16OC/min). Individual graphene crystal was transferred to SiO2/Si substrate by coating a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) supporting layer. Etching of underneath Cu foil was achieved by using a 50 mg/ml concentrated Fe(NO3)3 solution. Subsequently, PMMA/graphene stack layer was transferred to SiO2/Si substrate and PMMA coating was dissolved in acetone. Finally, transferred graphene was treated with a diluted nitric acid solution to remove the residual Fe(NO3)3 and dried in air.\n",

A quartz tube with 2 diameter was used as the reaction chamber for our CVD system. Cu foils were rolled up in a roll, but without the rolled-up layers touching to each other. Following the growth, PMMA was spun on graphene/Cu substrate to form PMMA/graphene/Cu sandwich structure. Later, Cu foil was etched away using an iron nitrate aqua solution. After the Cu foil was completely etched away, graphene with PMMA/graphene film was transferred onto a Si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2. The PMMA was then removed by repeatedly rinsing the film in acetone.\n",

        "5 g of graphite flakes (thickness ∼0.1 μm) was first immersed into 30 ml of ice cooled glutaric acid over night. The pretreated graphite flakes were filtered and left to dry at ambient conditions. The pretreated graphite subjected to a thermal shock at 700 °C for 1 min to expand the graphite. 500 mg of the expanded graphite flakes were dispersed in 50 ml methanol and sonicated for 10 min to ensure the complete dispersion of pretreated graphite in the methanol solution. The graphite solution was introduced into a Teflon autoclave with capacity 80 cm3 and put into microwave oven at power of 800 W and temperature 200 °C for 30 min. After this time, the reaction was terminated by put the Teflon autoclave into ice cooled bath. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging and washed several times with deionized water and HCl (10%). The graphene sheets were dried under vacuum over night at 70 °C.\n",

        "    'ground_truth' : ['''Dispersions of graphene in aqueous surfactant solutions were prepared by shear mixing using a Silverson L5M rotor-stator mixer. A solution of sodium cholate (SC) in de-ionised water (1 g/L) was prepared and then added to natural flake at 100 g/L with a  volume of 1L. Graphene was exfoliated using a 32 mm rotor at 4500 rpm for 60 min. The resulting dispersion was left to settle overnight, and the supernatant discarded. Fresh surfactant solution was then added, and the exfoliation repeated as before. The dispersion was left to settle for several hours before subjecting the supernatant to the centrifugation-based size selection. To select nanosheets by size, we used controlled centrifugation with sequentially increasing rotation speeds as previously reported. An initial centrifugation at 1500rpm (240g, 2 h) was performed to remove unexfoliated material. The supernatant was subjected to further centrifugation at 2000rpm (425g, 2h). The sediment was collected in fresh water-SC (SC concentration 0.1 g/L to facilitate imaging), while the supernatant was subjected to further centrifugation at 2500rpm (665g, 2h). Again, the sediment was collected, and the supernatant centrifuged at higher rpm. This procedure was repeated for 3000rpm (958g, 2h), 5000rpm (2660g, 2h), 10000rpm (10 170g, 2h) and 18000rpm (32 600g, 2h) to yield samples with decreasing sizes in the respective sediments. Compared with a method based on taking the supernatant from a single step centrifugation, this produces dispersions with lower polydispersity. This greatly facilitates microscopic characterization required to accurately determine length and thickness. A Hettich Mikro 220R centrifuge equipped with a fixed angle rotor 1016 and sample aliquots of 10 mL was used for rotations up to 5000rpm. For the high-speed centrifugations, 1.5 mL vials and a rotor 1195-A was used. In the case of the analysis of the stock-like dispersion, the sample of Asbury graphite exfoliated in SC was centrifuged at 1 krpm (104g, 2 h) and the sediment discarded. We note that the removal of non-exfoliated graphite is required for the metrics to be applicable.\n",

Then 6 g of KMnO4 was added slowly to the suspension under stirring to avoid any violent or explosive reactions and the temperature of the mixture was kept below 10oC by cooling. After adding the KMnO4 to the mixture, the dark green suspension was removed from the ice bath and the temperature was raised to 35 oC and maintained 1 h, which resulted in a thick paste. Then the mixture was diluted by 92 ml of water. Because of the addition of water in concentrated sulfuric acid medium a large amount of heat was released. Then the temperature was raised to 98 oC and maintained for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 280 ml of water and 30% H2O2, resulting in brown mixture.
